    \begin{abstract}
        An iterative algorithm for computing the Jones' polynomial of a knot
        is described and an analysis of the computational complexity is given.
        A generalized conjecture about the Jones' polynomial is shown to be
        false via counterexample, and a conjecture generalizing Kronheimer and
        Mrowka's result on the unknot is made, with supporting numerical
        evidence.
    \end{abstract}
    \section{Extended Gauss Code}
        Given a knot diagram, it is reasonable for a mathematician to wish to
        describe the knot with finite data in such a way that a computer can
        understand and perform computations. This is achieved via Gauss code.
