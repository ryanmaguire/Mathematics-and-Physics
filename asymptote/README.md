# Asymptote
This directory contains all of the code used to generate images produced by the
asymptote language. A gallery of these images can be found at the following
address:
[https://ryanmaguire.github.io/asymptote/](https://ryanmaguire.github.io/asymptote/)

Please note some strange lines appear in some of the images on the website. The
actual images in the PDF and the output from the codes do not contain these
lines. I'm guessing I formatted the website incorrectly somehow, but I can't see
why.
