    \chapter{Set Theory}
        This chapter will cover the necessary prerequisites before we dive into
        the various areas of mathematical analysis. This will include a short
        course on set theory and logic. We will develop set theory from the
        axioms known as Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory, together with the Axiom of
        Choice, commonly abbreviated as ZFC.
