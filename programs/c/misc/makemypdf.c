 *  Purpose:                                                                  *
 *      I use GNOME Builder when writing LaTeX docs because it's a nice IDE.  *
 *      It lacks the LaTeX plug-in available in VS Code, so I wrote this      *
 *      small bit of code to mimic that feature. It runs easily in GNOME      *
 *      Builder's terminal, essentially giving the same functionality for     *
 *      LaTeX docs as VS Code.                                                *
