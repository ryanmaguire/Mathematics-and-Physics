 *      Perform a simple raytracing of a black hole using classical physics,  *
 *      instead of relativity. Light is given an arbitrarily small mass and   *
 *      we use Newton's universal law of gravitation to see how a black hole  *
 *      would bend the light. This is a very rough estimate of black holes.   *
 *  Notes:                                                                    *

 *      I checked GNU's g++ with pedantic compiler warnings against C++98,    *
