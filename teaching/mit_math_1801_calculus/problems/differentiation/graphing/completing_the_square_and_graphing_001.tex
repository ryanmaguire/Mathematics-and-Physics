    Let $f$ be defined by:
    \[
        f(x)=x^{2}-4x+3
    \]
    By completing the square, shifting, and scaling, sketch a graph of
    $f$.

        \textbf{Solution:}
        \par\hfill\par
        We can factor $f$ directly, obtaining:
        \[
            f(x)=(x-3)(x-1)
        \]
        which tells us the roots of $f$ are $x=1$ and $x=3$. Let's complete
        the square. We have:
        \[
            x^{2}-4x=(x-2)^{2}-4
        \]
        And hence:
        \[
            f(x)=x^{2}-4x+3=(x-2)^{2}-1
        \]
        We know what the graph of $y=x^{2}$ looks like, it is an ordinary
        parabola. This final formula tells us we are shifting this familiar
        image vertically \textit{downwards} by 1 and horizontally to the
        \textit{right} by 2. This creates the image below.
