    Let $f$ be defined by:
    \[
        f(x)=x^{2}+2x+3
    \]
    By completing the square, shifting, and scaling, sketch a graph of
    $f$.

        \textbf{Solution:}
        \par\hfill\par
        The quadratic has no real roots. This can be verified using a bit
        of calculus. Application of the derivative shows us the smallest this
        function gets occurs at $x=-1$, and $f(-1)=2$. So we can't factor it
        with real numbers, but we can complete the square. We have:
        \[
            x^{2}+2x=(x+1)^{2}-1
        \]
        And hence:
        \[
            f(x)=x^{2}+2x+3=(x+1)^{2}+2
        \]
        We know what the graph of $y=x^{2}$ looks like, it is an ordinary
        parabola. This final formula tells us we are shifting this familiar
        image vertically \textit{upwards} by 2 and horizontally to the
        \textit{left} by 1. This creates the image below.
