    \begin{problem}[\textbf{Metric Spaces}]
        For non-empty subsets of a metric space $(X,\,d)$, define:
        \begin{equation}
            \textrm{Dist}(A,\,B)
            =\textrm{inf}\big(
                \{\,d(x,\,y)\;|\;x\in{A}\textrm{ and }y\in{B}\,\}
            \big)
        \end{equation}
        We've defined something similar, the $\textrm{dist}$ function,
        for points and subsets. This generalizes that function.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item (7 Pts) Let $(X,\,d)$ be a compact metric space and
                $\mathcal{C},\mathcal{D}\subseteq{X}$ non-empty closed
                subsets. Prove that if
                $\mathcal{C}\cap\mathcal{D}=\emptyset$ then
                $\textrm{Dist}(\mathcal{C},\,\mathcal{D})>0$.
            \item (3 Pts) Is this result still true if $(X,\,d)$ is not
                compact?
        \end{itemize}
    \end{problem}
    \begin{problem}[\textbf{General Topology}]
        Through this problem, if $(X,\,\tau_{X})$ and $(Y,\,\tau_{Y})$ are
        topological spaces, then $(X\times{Y},\,\tau_{X\times{Y}})$ is given
        the product topology. That is, $\tau_{X\times{Y}}$ is the
        topology generated by open rectangles $\mathcal{U}\times\mathcal{V}$
        with $\mathcal{U}\in\tau_{X}$ and $\mathcal{V}\in\tau_{Y}$.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item (2 Pts) Prove that the product of two Hausdorff
                spaces is Hausdorff.
            \item (2 Pts) Prove that the product of two second-countable spaces
                is second-countable.
            \item (6 Pts) Prove that the product of two topological manifolds
                is a topological manifold.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{problem}
    \begin{problem}[\textbf{Connectedness and Manifolds}]
        \par\hfill\par
        \begin{itemize}
            \item (10 Pts) Prove that a connected topological manifold is
                path connected.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{problem}
    \begin{problem}[\textbf{Compact Spaces}]
        A \textit{proper-map} from a topological space $(X,\,\tau_{X})$ to a
        topological space $(Y,\,\tau_{Y})$ is a function
        $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ such that for every compact subspace
        $K\subseteq{Y}$ it is true that $f^{-1}[K]\subseteq{X}$ is a compact
        subspace as well. Note: There is no assumption about continuity.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item (5 Pts) Prove that if $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ is a proper map,
                and if $(Y,\,\tau_{Y})$ is $\sigma$-compact, then
                $(X,\,\tau_{X})$ is $\sigma$-compact.
            \item (5 Pts) Prove that if $(X,\,\tau_{X})$ is compact, and if
                $(Y,\,\tau_{Y})$ is Hausdorff, then every continuous function
                $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ is a proper-map.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{problem}
    \begin{problem}[\textbf{Topological Groups}]
        \par\hfill\par
        \begin{itemize}
            \item (10 Pts) Let $(X,\,\tau,\,*)$ be a topological group, and let
                $H\subseteq{X}$ be a normal subgroup. Furthermore, let
                $(X,\,\tau)$ be a sequential topological space. Prove that
                $\textrm{Cl}_{\tau}(H)$ is a closed normal subgroup.
                [Note: There is no assumption that the space is Kolmogorov, or
                Frech\'{e}t, or Hausdorff. Also note, since $(X,\,\tau)$ is
                sequential, sequences are sufficient to describe closure.]
            \item (\textbf{Bonus: 5 Pts}) Prove that this claim is true even
                if $(X,\,\tau)$ is not a sequential topological space.
        \end{itemize}
