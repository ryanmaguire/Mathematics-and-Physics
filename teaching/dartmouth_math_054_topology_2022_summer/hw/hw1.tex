    \begin{problem}
        Now that we have constructed $\mathbb{Z}$, let's construct $\mathbb{Q}$,
        the set of rational numbers. Consider the set
        $\mathbb{Z}\times(\mathbb{Z}\setminus\{\,0\,\})$. Define the relation
        $R$ by $(a,b)R(c,d)$ if and only if $ad=bc$. (We are assuming we have
        already constructed multiplication for integers $n\in\mathbb{Z}$).
        \begin{itemize}
            \item (2 Points) Prove $R$ is an equivalence relation.
            \item (2 Points) For equivalence classes $[(a,b)]$ and $[(c,d)]$,
                define $[(a,b)]+[(c,d)]=[(ad+bc,bd)]$ (This is
                \textit{cross-multiplying}). Prove this is well-defined.
        \end{itemize}
        With this we write $[(a,b)]=\frac{a}{b}$.
    \end{problem}
    \begin{problem}
        Prove Cantor's theorem. If $A$ is a set, and $\mathcal{P}(A)$ is the
        power set of $A$, then there is no surjection
        $f:A\rightarrow\mathcal{P}(A)$.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item (1 Point) Suppose there is a surjection
                $f:A\rightarrow\mathcal{P}(A)$. Consider the set
                $B=\{\,x\in{A}\;|\;x\notin{f}(x)\,\}$. Describe in words what
                the set $B$ contains.
            \item (2 Points) Since $B\subseteq{A}$, and since $f$ is surjective,
                there is an element $a\in{A}$ such that $f(a)=B$. Show that
                this is a contradiction.
            \item (1 Point) Construct an injective function
                $g:A\rightarrow\mathcal{P}(A)$. (Hint: Given $a\in{A}$, what's
                an ``obvious'' subset we can send $a$ to?)
        \end{itemize}
    \end{problem}
    \begin{problem}
        We proved in class that a function
        $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ from a metric space $(X,d_{X})$ to a metric space
        $(Y,d_{Y})$ is continuous if and only if for every open subset
        $\mathcal{V}\subseteq{Y}$, the pre-image $f^{-1}[\mathcal{V}]$ is also
        open. You will now prove the equivalence of the third definition of
        continuity.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item (3 Points) Prove that if $f$ is continuous, then
                for all $\varepsilon>0$, and for all $x\in{X}$, there is a
                $\delta>0$ such that if $x_{0}\in{X}$ and
                $d_{X}(x,x_{0})<\delta$,
                then $d_{Y}\big(f(x),f(x_{0})\big)<\varepsilon$
                (Hint: Suppose not. Then there is an $\varepsilon>0$ such that
                for each $n\in\mathbb{N}$, $n>0$,
                there is a point $a_{n}\in{X}$ with $d_{X}(x,a_{n})<\frac{1}{n}$
                and $d_{Y}\big(f(x),f(a_{n})\big)\geq\varepsilon$. What is
                $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}a_{n}$? What is
                $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}f(a_{n})$? Is there a contradiction?)
            \item (3 Points) Prove that if $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ is a function
                such that for all $\varepsilon>0$ and for all $x\in{X}$, there
                is a $\delta>0$ such that for all $x_{0}\in{X}$,
                $d_{X}(x,x_{0})<\delta$ implies
                $d_{Y}\big(f(x),f(x_{0})\big)<\varepsilon$, then $f$ is
                continuous. (Hint: Let $a_{n}\rightarrow{x}$ by a convergent
                sequence. What does this property say about
                $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}f(a_{n})$?)
        \end{itemize}
    \end{problem}
    \begin{problem}
        A locally compact metric space is a metric space $(X,\,d)$ where for all
        $x\in{X}$ there is a compact set $K$ and an open set $\mathcal{U}$
        such that $x\in\mathcal{U}$ and $\mathcal{U}\subseteq{K}$
        (See Fig.~\ref{fig:locally_compact_metric_space_001}).
        \begin{itemize}
            \item (2 Points) Construct a metric space that is \textit{not}
                locally compact. Explain why it is not locally compact.
                (Hint: Il est utile de penser \'{a} la France).
        \end{itemize}
