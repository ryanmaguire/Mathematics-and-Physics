    \begin{problem}
        Now that we have constructed $\mathbb{Z}$, let's construct $\mathbb{Q}$,
        the set of rational numbers. Consider the set
        $\mathbb{Z}\times(\mathbb{Z}\setminus\{\,0\,\})$. Define the relation
        $R$ by $(a,b)R(c,d)$ if and only if $ad=bc$. (We are assuming we have
        already constructed multiplication for integers $n\in\mathbb{Z}$).
        \begin{itemize}
            \item (2 Points) Prove $R$ is an equivalence relation.
            \item (2 Points) For equivalence classes $[(a,b)]$ and $[(c,d)]$,
                define $[(a,b)]+[(c,d)]=[(ad+bc,bd)]$ (This is
                \textit{cross-multiplying}). Prove this is well-defined.
        \end{itemize}
        With this we write $[(a,b)]=\frac{a}{b}$.
    \end{problem}
    \color{black}
    \begin{proof}[Solution.]
        $R$ is reflexive. Given $(a,\,b)$ we have $ab=ba$ by the commutative
        property of multiplication, so $(a,\,b)R(a,\,b)$.
        \par\hfill\par
        $R$ is symmetric. If $(a,\,b)R(c,\,d)$, then $ad=bc$. But then
        $bc=ad$ since equality is symmetric. But then
        $cb=da$ since multiplication is commutative. Therefore,
        $(c,\,d)R(a,\,b)$.
        \par\hfill\par
        Lastly, $R$ is transitive. If $(a,\,b)R(c,\,d)$, then
        $ad=bc$. If $(c,\,d)R(e,\,f)$, then $cf=de$. Using this we have:
        \begin{align}
            (af)d
            &=(ad)f\tag{Associativity and Commutativity}\\
            &=(bc)f\tag{Substitution}\\
            &=b(cf)\tag{Associativity}\\
            &=b(de)\tag{Substitution}\\
            &=(be)d\tag{Associativity and Commutativity}
        \end{align}
        So $afd=bed$. But $d\in\mathbb{Z}\setminus\{\,0\,\}$, so $d$ is
        non-zero, and hence by the cancellation law of multiplication,
        $af=be$. That is, $(a,\,b)R(e,\,f)$, so $R$ is transitive. Since
        $R$ is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive, it is an equivalence
        relation.
        \par\hfill\par
        Addition of equivalence classes is well-defined here. Given
        $[(a,\,b)]=[(x,\,y)]$ and $[(c,\,d)]=[(z,\,w)]$, we have, since $R$ is
        an equivalence relation, that $(a,\,b)R(x,\,y)$ and
        $(c,\,d)R(z,\,w)$. That is, $ay=bx$ and $cw=dz$. We need to show that
        $[(ad+bc,\,bd)]=[(xw+yz,\,yw)]$, meaning we need to show that
        $(ad+bc)yw=(xw+yz)bd$. We have:
        \begin{align}
            (ad+bc)yw
            &=(ad)(yw)+(bc)(yw)\tag{Distributivity}\\
            &=(ay)(dw)+(bc)(yw)\tag{Associativity and Commutativity}\\
            &=(bx)(dw)+(bc)(yw)\tag{Substitution}\\
            &=(bx)(dw)+(cw)(by)\tag{Associativity and Commutativity}\\
            &=(bx)(dw)+(dz)(by)\tag{Substitution}\\
            &=(xw)(bd)+(dz)(by)\tag{Associativity and Commutativity}\\
            &=(xw)(bd)+(yz)(bd)\tag{Associativity and Commutativity}\\
            &=(xw+yz)bd\tag{Distributivity}
        \end{align}
        So $[(ad+bc,\,bd)]=[(xw+yz,\,yw)]$, and hence addition is well-defined.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{problem}
        Prove Cantor's theorem. If $A$ is a set, and $\mathcal{P}(A)$ is the
        power set of $A$, then there is no surjection
        $f:A\rightarrow\mathcal{P}(A)$.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item (1 Point) Suppose there is a surjection
                $f:A\rightarrow\mathcal{P}(A)$. Consider the set
                $B=\{\,x\in{A}\;|\;x\notin{f}(x)\,\}$. Describe in words what
                the set $B$ contains.
            \item (2 Points) Since $B\subseteq{A}$, and since $f$ is surjective,
                there is an element $a\in{A}$ such that $f(a)=B$. Show that
                this is a contradiction.
            \item (1 Point) Construct an injective function
                $g:A\rightarrow\mathcal{P}(A)$. (Hint: Given $a\in{A}$, what's
                an ``obvious'' subset we can send $a$ to?)
        \end{itemize}
    \end{problem}
    \color{black}
    \begin{proof}[Solution]
        The set $B$ is the set of all elements $a\in{A}$ such that the image of
        $a$ under $f$ does not contain $a$. That is, since $f$ takes elements
        of $A$ and returns subsets of $A$, it is possible for $a$ to be
        an element of $f(a)$. Consider $\mathbb{Z}_{3}$ and define
        $f:\mathbb{Z}_{3}\rightarrow\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{Z}_{3})$ by
        $f(0)=\{\,1,\,2\,\}$, $f(1)=\{\,0,\,1\,\}$, and
        $f(2)=\emptyset$. Then $0\notin{f}(0)$ since $f(0)$ only contains
        $1$ and $2$. We see that $1\in{f}(1)$ since $f(1)$ is a set containing
        $1$. Lastly, $2\notin{f}(2)$ since $f(2)$ is the empty set. The set
        $B$ consisting of all elements $a\in\mathbb{Z}_{3}$ such that
        $a\notin{f}(a)$ is $\{\,0,\,2\,\}$. Note that there is no element
        $n\in\mathbb{Z}_{3}$ such that $f(n)=B$.
        \par\hfill\par
        Suppose $f:A\rightarrow\mathcal{P}(A)$ is a surjection and $B$ is
        defined as above. Since $f$ is surjective, there is an $a\in{A}$
        such that $f(a)=B$. Suppose $a\in{B}$. Then $a\in{f}(a)$ since
        $f(a)=B$, a contradiction since $B$ is the set of all $x\in{A}$ such
        that $x\notin{f}(x)$. So $a\notin{B}$. But if $a\notin{B}$, then
        $a\notin{f}(a)$ since $f(a)=B$. But if $a\notin{f}(a)$, then
        $a\in{B}$ since $B$ is the set of all $x\in{A}$ such that
        $x\notin{f}(x)$. This is a contradiction meaning $a$ does not exist, so
        $f$ is not a surjection.
        \par\hfill\par
        There is an injective function $f:A\rightarrow\mathcal{P}(A)$.
        Define $f(a)=\{\,a\,\}$ for all $a\in{A}$. If
        $f(a)=f(b)$, then $\{\,a\,\}=\{\,b\,\}$, meaning $a=b$, so $f$
        is injective.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{problem}
        We proved in class that a function
        $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ from a metric space $(X,d_{X})$ to a metric space
        $(Y,d_{Y})$ is continuous if and only if for every open subset
        $\mathcal{V}\subseteq{Y}$, the pre-image $f^{-1}[\mathcal{V}]$ is also
        open. You will now prove the equivalence of the third definition of
        continuity.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item (3 Points) Prove that if $f$ is continuous, then
                for all $\varepsilon>0$, and for all $x\in{X}$, there is a
                $\delta>0$ such that if $x_{0}\in{X}$ and
                $d_{X}(x,x_{0})<\delta$,
                then $d_{Y}\big(f(x),f(x_{0})\big)<\varepsilon$
                (Hint: Suppose not. Then there is an $\varepsilon>0$ such that
                for each $n\in\mathbb{N}$, $n>0$,
                there is a point $a_{n}\in{X}$ with $d_{X}(x,a_{n})<\frac{1}{n}$
                and $d_{Y}\big(f(x),f(a_{n})\big)\geq\varepsilon$. What is
                $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}a_{n}$? What is
                $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}f(a_{n})$? Is there a contradiction?)
            \item (3 Points) Prove that if $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ is a function
                such that for all $\varepsilon>0$ and for all $x\in{X}$, there
                is a $\delta>0$ such that for all $x_{0}\in{X}$,
                $d_{X}(x,x_{0})<\delta$ implies
                $d_{Y}\big(f(x),f(x_{0})\big)<\varepsilon$, then $f$ is
                continuous. (Hint: Let $a_{n}\rightarrow{x}$ by a convergent
                sequence. What does this property say about
                $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}f(a_{n})$?)
        \end{itemize}
    \end{problem}
    \color{black}
    \begin{proof}[Solution.]
        Suppose $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ is continuous. Suppose there is an
        $\varepsilon>0$ and an $x\in{X}$ such that for all $\delta>0$ there
        is an $x_{0}\in{X}$ such that $d_{X}(x,\,x_{0})<\delta$
        and $d_{Y}\big(f(x),\,f(x_{0})\big)\geq\varepsilon$.
        Then, in particular, for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$ there is an
        $a_{n}\in{X}$ such that $d_{X}(x,\,a_{n})<\frac{1}{n+1}$, but
        $d_{Y}\big(f(x),\,f(a_{n})\big)\geq\varepsilon$. But then
        $d_{X}(x,\,a_{n})\rightarrow{0}$, and so $a_{n}\rightarrow{x}$. But $f$
        is continuous, so if $a_{n}\rightarrow{x}$, then
        $f(a_{n})\rightarrow{f}(x)$. That is, by the definition of convergence,
        there is an $N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and $n>N$
        implies $d_{Y}\big(f(x),\,f(a_{n})\big)<\varepsilon$. But for all
        $n\in\mathbb{N}$ we have $d_{Y}\big(f(x),\,f(a_{n})\big)\geq\varepsilon$
        which is a contradiction. Hence, for all $\varepsilon>0$ and for all
        $x\in{X}$ there is a $\delta>0$ such that for all $x_{0}\in{X}$ it is
        true that $d_{X}(x,\,x_{0})<\delta$ implies
        $d_{Y}\big(f(x),\,f(x_{0})\big)<\varepsilon$.
        \par\hfill\par
        Now suppose $f$ has the property that for all $x\in{X}$ and for
        all $\varepsilon>0$ there is a $\delta>0$ such that for all
        $x_{0}\in{X}$, $d_{X}(x,\,x_{0})<\delta$ implies
        $d_{Y}\big(f(x),\,f(x_{0})\big)<\varepsilon$. Suppose $f$ is not
        continuous. Then there is a convergent sequence
        $a:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow{X}$ and an $x\in{X}$ such that
        $a_{n}\rightarrow{x}$, but $f(a_{n})\not\rightarrow{f}(x)$.
        But then there is an $\varepsilon>0$ such that for all
        $N\in\mathbb{N}$ there is an $n\in\mathbb{N}$ with $n>N$ such that
        $d_{Y}\big(f(x),\,f(a_{n})\big)\geq\varepsilon$. But by the property
        of $f$, since $\varepsilon>0$ there is a $\delta>0$ such that
        for all $x_{0}\in{X}$, $d_{X}(x,\,x_{0})<\delta$ implies
        $d_{Y}\big(f(x),\,f(x_{0})\big)$. But $a_{n}\rightarrow{x}$ and
        $\delta>0$, so there is an $N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $n\in\mathbb{N}$
        and $n>N$ implies $d_{X}(x,\,a_{n})<\delta$. But then for all
        $n>N$ we have $d_{Y}\big(f(x),\,f(a_{n})\big)<\varepsilon$, a
        contradiction. Hence, $f$ is continuous.

    \begin{problem}
        A locally compact metric space is a metric space $(X,\,d)$ where for all
        $x\in{X}$ there is a compact set $K$ and an open set $\mathcal{U}$
        such that $x\in\mathcal{U}$ and $\mathcal{U}\subseteq{K}$
        (See Fig.~\ref{fig:locally_compact_metric_space_001}).
        \begin{itemize}
            \item (2 Points) Construct a metric space that is \textit{not}
                locally compact. Explain why it is not locally compact.
                (Hint: Il est utile de penser \'{a} la France).
        \end{itemize}
    \end{problem}

        \centering
        \includegraphics{../../../images/locally_compact_example_001.pdf}

    \color{black}
    Let $X=\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and
    $d_{P}:\mathbb{R}^{2}\times\mathbb{R}^{2}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$
    be the Paris metric:
    \begin{equation}
        d_{P}(\mathbf{x},\,\mathbf{y})=
        \begin{cases}
            ||\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}||_{2}&\mathbf{y}=\lambda\mathbf{x}
                \textrm{ for some }\lambda\in\mathbb{R}\\
            ||\mathbf{x}||_{2}+||\mathbf{y}||_{2}&\textrm{otherwise}
        \end{cases}
    \end{equation}
    For every point $\mathbf{x}\ne\mathbf{0}$, the point $\mathbf{x}$ has the
    local compactness property. Choosing $r=||\mathbf{x}||_{2}/2$, the
    open ball of radius $r$ centered at $\mathbf{x}$ in the Paris plane is
    essentially an \textit{open interval}, topologically similar to the open
    unit interval $(0,\,1)$. By adding the end points of this interval,
    that is, the points two points $\mathbf{y}$ lying on the line between the
    origin and $\mathbf{x}$ such that $||\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}||_{2}=r$, then
    we get a set that topologically looks like the closed interval
    $[0,\,1]$, which is compact by the Heine-Borel theorem. So we have found
    an open set $\mathcal{U}$ and a compact set $K$ such that
    $\mathbf{x}\in\mathcal{U}$ and $\mathcal{U}\subseteq{K}$. If we are going
    to prove the Paris plane is not locally compact, we're going to have to
    look at the origin. Suppose the Paris plane is locally compact. Then there
    is an open set $\mathcal{U}\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and a compact set
    $K\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{2}$ such that $\mathbf{0}\in\mathcal{U}$ and
    $\mathcal{U}\subseteq{K}$. But since $\mathbf{0}\in\mathcal{U}$ and
    $\mathcal{U}$ is open, there is an $\varepsilon>0$ such that
    $B_{\varepsilon}^{(\mathbb{R}^{2},\,d_{P})}(\mathbf{0})\subseteq\mathcal{U}$.
    Since $\mathcal{U}\subseteq{K}$, we have
    $B_{\varepsilon}^{(\mathbb{R}^{2},\,d_{P})}(\mathbf{0})\subseteq{K}$.
    Define $a:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow{K}$ by:
    \begin{equation}
        a_{n}=\frac{\varepsilon}{2}\Big(
            \cos\big(\frac{\pi}{n+1}\big),\,\sin\big(\frac{\pi}{n+1}\big)
        \Big)
    \end{equation}
    This function is injective since $f(n)=\frac{\pi}{n+1}$ is injective, and
    $\big(\cos(t),\,\sin(t)\big)$ is injective for $t\in[0,\,\pi]$. Moreover,
    since every $n\in\mathbb{N}$ corresponds to a different angle, no
    two points $a_{n}$ and $a_{m}$ lie on the same line through the origin.
    But then, for all $n,m\in\mathbb{N}$, we have:
    \begin{equation}
        d_{P}(a_{m},\,a_{n})
        =||a_{m}||_{2}+||a_{n}||_{2}
        =\frac{\varepsilon}{2}+\frac{\varepsilon}{2}
        =\varepsilon
    \end{equation}
    That is, $a:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is not a Cauchy sequence
    since the distance betwen distinct points does not converge to zero, but
    rather is a constant. Moreover, no subsequence can converge since for
    any subsequence $a_{k}$, since $k$ must be strictly increasing, we also
    have $d_{P}(a_{k_{m}},\,a_{k_{n}})=\varepsilon$ for all $m\ne{n}$.
    We have constructed a sequence that has no convergent subsequence.
    But $a:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow{K}$ is a sequence in a compact set, so it must
    have a convergent subsequence, which is a contradiction. Therefore,
    $(\mathbb{R}^{2},\,d_{P})$ is \textit{not} locally compact.
