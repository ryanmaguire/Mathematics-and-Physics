    \maketitle
    The fundamental theorem of calculus relates integration and differentiation.
    It can be used to rigorously find the anti-derivative of various functions,
    and to explicitly solve the area under certain curves. The proof isn't too
    bad either, but first let's get some intuition as to \textit{why} it is
    true. The theorem states that if $f:[a,b]\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is a
    continuous function, and if $F:[a,b]\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is defined by:
    \begin{equation}
        F(x)=\int_{a}^{x}f(t)\;\textrm{d}t
    \end{equation}
    Then $F$ is differentiable, and:
    \begin{equation}
        \frac{\textrm{d}F}{\textrm{d}x}(x)=f(x)
    \end{equation}
    Written more concisely:
    \begin{equation}
        \frac{\textrm{d}}{\textrm{d}x}\int_{a}^{x}f(t)\;\textrm{d}t=f(x)
    \end{equation}
    Intuitively this makes sense, we just need to understand the picture.
    The expression $\textrm{d}\big(\int_{a}^{x}f(t)\;\textrm{d}t\big)$
    asks how much more
    area do we get if we increment $x$ infinitesimally so. That is, if we
    increment from $x$ to $x+\textrm{d}x$ for an infinitesimally small
    $\textrm{d}x$, how much more area do we have? Well, this is the height at
    the point $x$ times the displacement, which is $f(x)\textrm{d}x$. The value
    $\frac{\textrm{d}}{\textrm{d}x}\int_{a}^{x}f(t)\textrm{d}t$ then asks for
    the ratio of this change with respect to the increment $\textrm{d}x$.
    Informally we have $f(x)\textrm{d}x/\textrm{d}x$ and the $\textrm{d}x$
    cancel, leaving $f(x)$. So, the \textit{rate of change} of the area under
    $f$ as a function of $x$ is simply the height of $f$, or $f(x)$. This
    geometrically makes sense (See Fig.~\ref{fig:intuition}).

    Unfortunately, all of this is very
    \textit{imprecise} and may have passed as a proof in the 1600's, but not
    in modern times. We need to be more rigorous. We start with the
    \textit{mean value theorem for integrals}.
    \begin{theorem}
        If $f:[a,b]\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is a continuous function, $a<b$,
        then there is a point $c\in[a,b]$ such that:
        \begin{equation}
            f(c)=\frac{1}{b-a}\int_{a}^{b}f(x)\;\textrm{d}x
        \end{equation}
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        Note that $\int_{a}^{b}f(x)\textrm{d}x$ is just a number. Label this
        number $A$ (for Area). Define $g:[a,b]\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ to be:
        \begin{equation}
            g(x)=f(x)(b-a)-A
        \end{equation}
        Since $f$ is continuous, $g$ is continuous. But since $f$ is continuous,
        by the extreme value theorem there are points $x_{\textrm{min}}$ and
        $x_{\textrm{max}}$ in $[a,b]$ where $f(x)$ achieves its minimum and
        maximum, respectively. Then $g(x_{\textrm{min}})$ will be
        non-positive since the upper Riemann sum is always greater than or
        equal $f(x_{\textrm{min}})(b-a)$, and $g(x_{\textrm{max}})$ will be
        non-negative. By the intermediate value theorem, since $g$ is
        continuous, there is some point $c\in[a,b]$ where $g(c)=0$. But then:
        \begin{equation}
            f(c)(b-a)-\int_{a}^{b}f(x)\;\textrm{d}x=0
        \end{equation}
        Which completes the proof.
    \end{proof}
    See Fig.~\ref{fig:mvt} for a visual.

    \end{figure}
    We can now prove the fundamental theorem of calculus. We have:
    \begin{align}
        \frac{\textrm{d}}{\textrm{d}x}\int_{a}^{x}f(t)\;\textrm{d}t
        &=\lim_{h\rightarrow{0}}\frac{1}{h}\Big(
            \int_{a}^{x+h}f(t)\;\textrm{d}t-
            \int_{a}^{x}f(t)\;\textrm{d}t\Big)\\
        &=\lim_{h\rightarrow{0}}\frac{1}{h}
            \int_{x}^{x+h}f(t)\;\textrm{d}t\\
        &=\lim_{h\rightarrow{0}}\frac{1}{h}f(c_{h})(x+h-x)\\
        &=\lim_{h\rightarrow{0}}\frac{1}{h}f(c_{h})h\\
        &=\lim_{h\rightarrow{0}}f(c_{h})
    \end{align}
    Here, $c_{h}$ is a value between $x$ and $x+h$ such that:
    \begin{equation}
        f(c_{h})=\frac{1}{x+h-x}\int_{x}^{x+h}f(t)\;\textrm{d}t
    \end{equation}
    which exists by the mean value theorem for integrals.
    Since $c_{h}\in[x,x+h]$, as $h$ tends to zero, $c_{h}$ tends to $x$.
    But $f$ is continuous, and therefore:
    \begin{equation}
        \lim_{h\rightarrow{0}}f(c_{h})=f(x)
    \end{equation}
    Which completes the proof.
