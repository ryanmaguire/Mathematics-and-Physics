    \maketitle
    A result known back to the times of Euclid (300 B.C.E) states that if
    $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, and if $ab=0$, then either $a=0$, or
    $b=0$ (or both). The proof is quite simple. If $a$ is not zero, then
    we can divide both sides of $ab=0$ by $a$, and we obtain $b=0$. Similarly,
    if $b$ is not zero, then we can divide both sides of $ab=0$ by $b$ and
    obtain $a=0$. Hence, if $ab=0$, then at least one of these must be zero.
    We can use this result to find for which real numbers a formula may be
    undefined.

    Let's consider the following expression:
    \begin{equation}
        f(x)=\frac{1}{x(1-x^{2})}
    \end{equation}
    For what subset of the real numbers is this formula well-defined? The only
    problem we could encounter is a division-by-zero. The denominator of the
    expression is $x(1-x^{2})$, so we need to exclude real numbers where this
    evaluates to zero. Using the statement from the first paragraph, if
    $x(1-x^{2})=0$, then either $x=0$, or $1-x^{2}=0$. The expression
    $1-x^{2}=0$ has two solutions, $1$ and $-1$. We can see this by factoring,
    obtaining $1-x^{2}=(1+x)(1-x)$. So, in total, there are 3 real numbers
    where this formula is not well-defined: 0, 1, and $-1$. Using the notation
    from set theory, we can write the domain of $f$ via:
    \begin{equation}
        D=(-\infty,-1)\cup(-1,0)\cup(0,1)\cup(1,\infty)
    \end{equation}
    The function is plotted in Fig~\ref{fig:graph_of_f}.
