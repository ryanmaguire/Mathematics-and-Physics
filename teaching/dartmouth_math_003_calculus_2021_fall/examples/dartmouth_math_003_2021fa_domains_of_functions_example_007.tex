    \maketitle
    Consider the expression:
    \begin{equation}
        f(x)=\frac{1}{\frac{1}{x}-1}
    \end{equation}
    We can simplify this by the following:
    \begin{align}
        f(x)&=\frac{1}{\frac{1}{x}-1}\\
            &=\frac{x}{x}\cdot\frac{1}{\frac{1}{x}-1}\\
            &=\frac{x}{1-x}
    \end{align}
    If we examine this new expression we might conclude that the only value
    where $f(x)$ may be undefined is $x=1$, since then $1-x$ would evaluate to
    zero and our expression would have a division-by-zero. However, in the
    simplification we multiplied our expression by $\frac{x}{x}$. For all
    values other than zero this simplifies to 1, and is therefore a valid
    step, but for 0 this expression is undefined. Looking back to our original
    expression we see that $\frac{1}{x}$ occurs in the denominator. For this
    to be well-defined, we need to avoid $x=0$ as well. The domain can be
    written as:
    \begin{equation}
        D=(-\infty, 0)\cup(0,1)\cup(1,\infty)
    \end{equation}
    This function is plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig:graph_of_func}.
