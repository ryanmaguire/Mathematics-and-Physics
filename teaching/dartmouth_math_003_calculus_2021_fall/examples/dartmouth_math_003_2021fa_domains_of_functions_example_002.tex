    \maketitle
    When an expression involves logarithmic functions such as the natural
    log we need to be careful that the input is positive. The log base
    $b$ (with $b>1$) of a real number $x$ returns the number $y$ such that
    $x=b^{y}$. Since $b^{y}$ can never be negative, $\log_{b}(x)$ has no
    meaning for negative values of $x$. For 0, we can say
    $\log_{b}(0)=-\infty$ since $b^{-\infty}=0$ (more precisely, $b^{x}$ tends
    to zero as $x$ approaches $-\infty$), but $-\infty$ is not a real
    number and so 0 must be excluded from the input of $\log_{b}$.
    A plot of $2^{x}$ is given in Fig.~\ref{fig:two_to_the_x} hinting that
    $2^{x}$ is never negative and tends to $0$ as $x$ tends to $-\infty$.

    Consider the expression below:
    \begin{equation}
        f(x)=\frac{1}{x\ln(x)}
    \end{equation}
    There are a few restrictions on $x$ for $f(x)$ to be well-defined. Firstly,
    we have a division so we need the denominator to be non-zero. We must
    avoid $x\ln(x)=0$. If $x\ln(x)=0$, then either $x=0$ or $\ln(x)=0$. For
    any $b>1$, $\log_{b}(x)=0$ is true precisely when $x=1$. If we want
    $1=b^{y}$, we use that fact that for any non-zero real number $b$ it is
    true that $b^{0}=1$. This gives us $\log_{b}(1)=0$. So, in particular,
    $\ln(1)=0$. To avoid a division-by-zero in our expression we need
    $x\ne{0}$ and $x\ne{1}$. There is another restriction. We need that
    $\ln(x)$ is well-defined as well. This occurs when $x>0$. So, in total
    we need $x\ne{0}$, $x\ne{1}$, and $x>0$. The requirement $x>0$ excludes
    0 so we can rid ourselves of the first requirement, and need
    $x>0$ and $x\ne{1}$. We can write the domain of $f$ as:
    \begin{equation}
        D=(0,1)\cup(1,\infty)
    \end{equation}
    The function is plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig:one_by_x_lnx}.
