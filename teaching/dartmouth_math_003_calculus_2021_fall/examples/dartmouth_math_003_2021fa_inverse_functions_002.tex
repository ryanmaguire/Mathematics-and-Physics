    \maketitle
    Consider the following expression:
    \begin{equation}
        f(x)=\frac{1}{\ln(x)}
    \end{equation}
    The largest possible domain is $(0,1)\cup(1,\infty)$ and the range of the
    function is $(-\infty,0)\cup(0,\infty)$. To see this, note that
    $\ln(x)$ has the range of $(-\infty,\infty)$, so $1/\ln(x)$ will only be
    missing zero in it's range. That is, since for every non-zero number $y$
    there is a non-zero $x$ such that $y=1/x$, the range of $1/\ln(x)$ will be
    every non-zero real number. With respect to the domain
    $(0,1)\cup(1,\infty)$ and the range $(-\infty,0)\cup(0,\infty)$, $f$ is
    \textit{bijective} meaning $f(x_0)=f(x_{1})$ implies $x_{0}=x_{1}$,
    and for any value $y\in(-\infty,0)\cup(0,\infty)$ there is a value $x$
    such that $y=f(x)$. We won't prove this, but it can be verified from the
    graph of $1/\ln(x)$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:one_by_ln_x}. This means we can define
    the inverse of $f$. Let's try to compute what it is. To do this, we set up
    the equation $y=f(x)$ and apply various operations to both sides until
    we've isolated $x$ in the form $x=g(y)$. This function $g$ is the inverse
    of $f$. Let's try this.
    \begin{align}
        y&=f(x)\\
        y&=\frac{1}{\ln(x)}\\
        \frac{1}{y}&=\ln(x)\\
        \exp\big(\frac{1}{y}\big)&=x
    \end{align}
    So, the inverse function is:
    \begin{equation}
        f^{-1}(x)=\exp\big(\frac{1}{x}\big)
    \end{equation}
    The domain is $(-\infty,0)\cup(0,\infty)$, which is precisely the range of
    $f$. This is not a coincidence. Like all inverse functions, the plot can
    be made by reflecting $f$ across the line $y=x$. This is done in
    Fig.~\ref{fig:one_by_ln_x_and_inverse}.
