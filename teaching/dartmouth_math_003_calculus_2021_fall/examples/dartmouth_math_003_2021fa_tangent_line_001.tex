    \maketitle
    Let's find the equation of the tangent line of
    $f(x)=2x-3x^{3}+x^{5}$ at $x_{0}=1$. The difference quotient for any real
    number $x\in\mathbb{R}$ is:
    \begin{equation}
        \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}
    \end{equation}
    This is the slope of the \textit{secant line} passing through the
    points $(x,f(x))$ and $(x+h,f(x+h))$. Using $f(x)=2x-3x^{3}+x^{5}$ we get:
    \begin{equation}
        \frac{2(x+h)-3(x+h)^{3}+(x+h)^{5}-\big(2x-3x^{3}+x^{5}\big)}{h}
    \end{equation}
    As $h$ approaches zero, this secant line better approximates the
    \textit{tangent} line. This is shown in
    Fig.~\ref{fig:sec_line}. In fact, the limit as $h$ tends to zero
    \textit{is} the tangent line. The limit as $h$ tends to zero is also the
    definition of the derivative:
    \begin{equation}
        \frac{\textrm{d}f}{\textrm{d}x}(x)
            =f'(x)
            =\lim_{h\rightarrow{0}}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}
    \end{equation}
    The notations $\frac{\textrm{d}f}{\textrm{d}x}(x)$ and $f'(x)$ are
    equivalent. In physics one often sees $\dot{f}(x)$ (read aloud as
    \textit{f dot of x}), and this too means the derivative of $f$ at $x$.
    \par\hfill\par
    Let's use the \textit{sum rule} for differentiation, which says that if
    $g_{0}$ and $g_{1}$ are differentiable functions, then:
    \begin{equation}
        \frac{\textrm{d}}{\textrm{d}x}\big(g_{0}(x)+g_{1}(x)\big)
        =\frac{\textrm{d}g_{0}}{\textrm{d}x}(x)+
            \frac{\textrm{d}g_{1}}{\textrm{d}x}(x)
    \end{equation}
    Applying this to $f$, we have:
    \begin{equation}
        \frac{\textrm{d}f}{\textrm{d}x}(x)
        =\frac{\textrm{d}(2x)}{\textrm{d}x}+
        \frac{\textrm{d}(-3x^{3})}{\textrm{d}x}+
        \frac{\textrm{d}(x^{5})}{\textrm{d}x}
    \end{equation}
    Next we use the fact that constants can be factored out of the derivative.
    This gives us:
    \begin{equation}
        \frac{\textrm{d}f}{\textrm{d}x}(x)
        =2\frac{\textrm{d}(x)}{\textrm{d}x}-
        3\frac{\textrm{d}(x^{3})}{\textrm{d}x}+
        \frac{\textrm{d}(x^{5})}{\textrm{d}x}
    \end{equation}
    To wrap this up, we apply the \textit{power rule}. This says, for a
    function of the form $g(x)=x^{n}$, the derivative can be computed as:
    $g'(x)=nx^{n-1}$. That is:
    \begin{equation}
        \frac{\textrm{d}(x^{n})}{\textrm{d}x}
        =nx^{n-1}
    \end{equation}
    Using this, the derivative of $f$ becomes:
    \begin{align}
        \frac{\textrm{d}f}{\textrm{d}x}(x)
        &=2\frac{\textrm{d}(x)}{\textrm{d}x}-
            3\frac{\textrm{d}(x^{3})}{\textrm{d}x}+
            \frac{\textrm{d}(x^{5})}{\textrm{d}x}\\
        &=2-3(3x^{2})+5x^{4}\\
        &=2-9x^{2}+5x^{4}
    \end{align}
    Since we now know that $f'(x)=2-9x^{2}+5x^{4}$, we can compute the slope of
    the tangent line of $f$ at $x_{0}=1$ by evaluating $f'$ at 1. We get:
    \begin{equation}
        f'(1)=2-9(1)^{2}+5(1)^{4}=2-9+5=-2
    \end{equation}
    So the slope of at $x_{0}=1$ is $-2$. The tangent line has the formula:
    \begin{equation}
        y_{T}=m(x-x_{0})+y_{0}
    \end{equation}
    We know the slope is $m=f'(x_{0})=f'(1)=-2$, so we now have:
    \begin{equation}
        y_{T}=-2(x-x_{0})+y_{0}
    \end{equation}
    When we plug in $x=x_{0}$ we see that the right hand side becomes $y_{0}$.
    We want the tangent line of $f$ at $x_{0}$ to have both the same
    \textit{slope} as $f$ at $x_{0}$, and the same \textit{height}. That is,
    we want $y_{T}$ and $f$ to meet at $x=x_{0}$. To do this, we see that we
    need $y_{0}=f(x_{0})$. Since we chose $x_{0}=1$, we can compute this:
    \begin{equation}
        y_{0}=f(x_{0})=f(1)=2(1)-3(1)^{3}+(1)^{5}=2-3+1=0
    \end{equation}
    So $y_{0}=0$, and thus the tangent line is:
    \begin{equation}
        y_{T}=-2(x-x_{0})
    \end{equation}
    This is plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig:tan_line}.
