    \maketitle
    The trigonometric function sine measures the height of a point on the
    unit circle as a function of the angle this point makes with the $x$ axis.
    From this we can see that $\sin(x)$ will lie between $-1$ and $1$ for any
    input $x$, but we can also see that there are angles that result in
    $0$. In particular, for every integer $n$ (positive, negative, or zero),
    $\sin(n\pi)=0$. The graph of $\sin(x)$ is shown in
    Fig.~\ref{fig:sin_x}.
    \par\hfill\par
    Consider the expression:
    \begin{equation}
        f(x)=\frac{x}{\sin(x)}
    \end{equation}
    For which values is $f(x)$ well-defined? $\sin(x)$ is well-defined for any
    real number, so the only thing to look out for is a division-by-zero.
    This occurs precisely when $\sin(x)=0$, which we've stated happens at the
    values $x=n\pi$ where $n$ is any integer. So the domain is the set:
    \begin{equation}
        D=\{\,x\in\mathbb{R}\,|\,x\ne{n\pi}\textit{ for any }n\in\mathbb{Z}\,\}
    \end{equation}
    This reads that $D$ is the set of all real numbers $x$ such that $x$ is
    not equal to $n\pi$ for any $n\in\mathbb{Z}$. The set $\mathbb{Z}$ is the
    set of all integers, positive, negative, or zero. Use of the letter Z stems
    from the German word \textit{Zahl}, meaning number.
    \par\hfill\par
    If we examine Fig.~\ref{fig:x_by_sin_x} we see something peculiar happen
    at $x=0$. Even though we have a division-by-zero, the function seems well
    behaved in this region. This is because the \textit{limit} as $x$
    approaches zero for $x/\sin(x)$ is well behaved and tends towards 1. We
    don't yet have the machinery to prove this, but this is an example of a
    function such that $f(0)$ is undefined, yet the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$
    approaches 0 is well-defined.
