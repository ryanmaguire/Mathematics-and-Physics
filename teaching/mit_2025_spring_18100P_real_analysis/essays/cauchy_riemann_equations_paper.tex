        Over the past few centuries complex analysis has found its way into all
        of the physical and applied sciences. From electromagnetic waves and
        circuits to computer graphics, the ability to add and multiply points
        in the plane in a meaningful and geometric way has far applications,
        but perhaps most import is the ability to differentiate functions of
        a complex variable. It is well known that a function
        $f:\mathbb{C}\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$ is differentiable if and only if
        it satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations. We prove this rigorously
        in a mostly self-contained manner and provide physical geometric
        interpretations of this theorem.

    \section{Introduction}
        There is a natural way to add points in the Euclidean plane
        $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ by using \textit{vector addition}. Given
        $P=(x_{0},\,y_{0})$ and $Q=(x_{1},\,y_{1})$, we may sum $P$ and $Q$
        together by simply adding their components:
        \begin{equation}
            P+Q
            =(x_{0},\,y_{0})+(x_{1},\,y_{1})
            =(x_{0}+x_{1},\,y_{0}+y_{1})
        \end{equation}
        See Fig.~\ref{fig:complex_number_addition_001}.
        \begin{figure}

            \label{fig:complex_number_addition_001}
        \end{figure}
        The definition of multiplying points is not so clear at first glance.
        One such method is motivatived by the study of polynomial equations.
        Cardano, in his \textit{Ars Magna} (1545 C.E.), writes that
        one may solve $x(10-x)=40$ if they allow for negative square roots,
        such as $5-\sqrt{-15}$ and $5+\sqrt{-15}$
        \cite[p.~252]{KlineMathematicalHistory}, and later on he gives a
        solution for cubic equations of the form
        $x^{3}+mx-n=0$ (with $m$ and $n$ given) using auxiliary terms $t$
        and $u$ given by \cite[p.~264]{KlineMathematicalHistory}:
        \begin{equation}
            \begin{array}{rcl}
                \displaystyle
                t
                &=&
                \displaystyle
                \sqrt{\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{m}{3}\right)^{3}}
                +\frac{n}{2}\\[1.5em]
                \displaystyle
                u
                &=&
                \displaystyle
                \sqrt{\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{m}{3}\right)^{3}}
                -\frac{n}{2}\\
            \end{array}
        \end{equation}
        For a cubic such as $x^{3}-6x-2=0$, which has three \textit{real} roots,
        we require square roots of \textit{negative} numbers. The multiplicative
        operation on the complex plane can be defined by modeling this behavior.
        We set $i=(0,\,1)$ and require $i^{2}=-1$. Algebraically, we are
        constructing a \textit{field extension} over the real numbers,
        $\mathbb{C}=\mathbb{R}[i]$, where we are \textit{adjoining} $i$ to
        $\mathbb{R}$ and writing $z\in\mathbb{C}$ as $z=a+ib$ with
        $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$ \cite[p.~512]{DummitAndFooteAbstractAlgebra}.
        While this is very formal and precise, it is far from concrete or
        geometric. If we set out to define a multiplication on $\mathbb{R}^{2}$,
        then by the Frobenius theorem \cite[p.~452]{JacobsonBasicAlgebraI}
        there is only one way (up to isomorphism) to do this in a \textit{nice}
        manner. That is, to produce a field structure
        $(\mathbb{R}^{2},\,+,\,\times)$ that is \textit{compatible} with the
        real number system $(\mathbb{R},\,+,\,\times)$, there must be some
        fixed negative real number $r$ such that:
        \begin{equation}
            (x_{0},\,y_{0})\times(x_{1},\,y_{1})
            =(x_{0}x_{1}+ry_{0}y_{1},\,x_{0}y_{1}+x_{1}y_{0})
        \end{equation}
        By compatible, formally we mean that the complex numbers form an
        \textit{algebra} over the reals.
        Algebraically any choice of $r<0$ will do.
        Choosing $r=-1$ is the geometrically reasonable selection since now
        our multiplication is compatible with the Pythagorean formula:
        \begin{equation}
            \|(x_{0},\,y_{0})\times(x_{1},\,y_{1})\|
            =\|(x_{0},\,y_{0})\|\;\|(x_{1},\,y_{1})\|
        \end{equation}
        Where $\|\cdot\|$ denotes the Euclidean norm given by the
        Pythagorean formula. This produces the same structure as the more
        abstract field extension method, and we may write
        $z=(x,\,y)=x+iy$ to jump back and forth between the two notions.
        By treating complex numbers purely as points in the plane, there is
        a third interpretations that is very geometric. Complex numbers are
        \textit{matrices} (see \cite[p.~25]{PetersenLinearAlgebra} for a
        simple example). Since multiplication satisfies the
        distributive law, $(z_{0}+z_{1})w=z_{0}w+z_{1}w$, we may think of
        $w=a+ib$ as a linear function
        $f:\mathbb{R}^{2}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{2}$ given by $f(z)=zw$.
        There is thus a representative matrix. To calculate the entries
        we simply compute $f\big((1,\,0)\big)$ and $f\big((0,\,1)\big)$,
        giving us:
        \begin{equation}
            w=
            \begin{bmatrix}
                a&-b\\
                b&\phantom{+}a
            \end{bmatrix}
        \end{equation}
        If $\|w\|=1$, we may write $w=\cos(\theta)+i\sin(\theta)$ for some
        real angle $\theta$. The representative matrix is then:
        \begin{equation}
            w=
            \begin{bmatrix}
                \cos(\theta)&-\sin(\theta)\\[0.5em]
                \sin(\theta)&\phantom{+}\cos(\theta)
            \end{bmatrix}
        \end{equation}
        This is a \textbf{rotation matrix}. That is, complex arithmetic
        describes geometric transformations of the plane. The combination
        of these interpretations result in complex analysis invading every
        branch of mathematics: algebra, analysis, combinatorics, geometry,
        mathematical physics, number theory, topology, and applied mathematics.
        In physics we describe electromagnetic waves using complex numbers
        \cite[p.~380]{WangsnessElectromagneticFields}, the central postulate
        behind quantum mechanics is the Schr\"{o}dinger equation which models
        quantum systems using complex numbers
        (\cite[p.~1]{GriffithsQuantumMechanics},
        \cite[p.~68]{McIntyreQuantumMechanics}), in acoustics and
        audio engineering the Fourier transform is used decompose sounds into
        their component frequencies
        \cite[p.~28]{MorseIngbardTheoreticalAcoustics}, and in computer
        graphics we use complex numbers (and \textit{quaternions}) to describe
        how we scale and rotate vectors. The list of applications goes on
        and on. Most of these applications use more than the fact that complex
        arithmetic has a geometric meaning, they often need \textit{ratios}
        to well-defined when the denominator is non-zero.
        To keep the notation fixed, we provide the following definition.
        \begin{definition}[\textbf{Complex Numbers}]
            A complex number is a point in the plane $z\in\mathbb{R}^{2}$
            represented by writing $z=x+iy$ with $x,y\in\mathbb{R}$ where $x$
            is the \textit{real part} and $y$ is the \textit{imaginary part}.
            Arithmetic is given by the associative, commutative, and
            distributive laws (i.e., real arithmetic plus factoring the $i$
            symbol), and by using $i^{2}=-1$. We write
            $\mathbb{R}^{2}=\mathbb{C}$ when we explicitly wish to think of
            points as complex numbers, rather than geometric points in the
            Euclidean plane.
        \end{definition}
        This arithmetic allows us to define division as follows.
        Given $z=x+iy$, with $(x,\,y)\ne(0,\,0)$, we have:
        \begin{equation}
            z^{-1}=\frac{x-iy}{x^{2}+y^{2}}
        \end{equation}
        The geometric interpretation is shown in
        Fig.~\ref{fig:complex_number_division_001}. We subtract angles and
        scale by the ratio of the magnitudes for the two vectors.
        \begin{figure}
            \centering
            \includegraphics{complex_number_division_001}
            \caption{Visual for Division of Complex Numbers}
            \label{fig:complex_number_division_001}
        \end{figure}
        There is a straight-forward metric we can place on the complex plane
        given by the Pythagorean formula. Namely, given
        $z=x_{0}+iy_{0}$ and $w=x_{1}+iy_{1}$, we write:
        \begin{equation}
            \operatorname{dist}(z,\,w)
            =\|(x_{0},\,y_{0})-(x_{1},\,y_{1})\|
            =\sqrt{(x_{0}-x_{1})^{2}+(y_{0}-y_{1})^{2}}
        \end{equation}
        The \textbf{modulus} of a complex number $z=x+iy$ is given by
        $|z|=\|(x,\,y)\|$, meaning we may also write
        $\operatorname{dist}(z,\,w)=|z-w|$. With this, convergence of sequences
        is well-defined, and the complex numbers have a notion of
        \textit{Cauchy sequences} as well. Indeed, the complex numbers are
        \textbf{complete}: all Cauchy sequences converge
        \cite[p.~33]{AlhforsComplexAnalysis}. Continuity may then be defined
        as follows.
        \begin{definition}[\textbf{Continuous Function}]
            A continuous complex-valued function of a complex variable is a
            function $f:\mathbb{C}\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$ such that for every
            convergent sequence $a:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$ we have:
            \begin{equation}
                \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}f(a_{n})
                =f\left(\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}a_{n}\right)
            \end{equation}
            That is, the image of a convergent sequence under $f$ is again a
            convergent sequence.
        \end{definition}
        \subsection{Differentiation and The Cauchy-Riemann Equations}
            Since the complex numbers form a field, we may take two sequences
            of non-zero complex numbers and take their quotient. Differentiation
            may be defined in the exact same manner as real numbers in this
            respect.
            \begin{definition}[\textbf{Differentiable Function}]
                A differentiable complex-valued function of a complex variable
                is a function $f:\mathbb{C}\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$ such that
                for all $z_{0}\in\mathbb{C}$ and for any sequence
                $a:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$ that converges to
                $z_{0}$, the sequence of ratios converges. That is:
                \begin{equation}
                    f^{\prime}(z_{0})
                    =\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}
                    \frac{f(a_{n})-f(z_{0})}{a_{n}-z_{0}}
                \end{equation}
                is well-defined.
            \end{definition}
            Alternatively, we may look at sequences $h_{n}\rightarrow{0}$
            and consider:
            \begin{equation}
                f^{\prime}(z_{0})
                =\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}
                \frac{f(z_{0}+h_{n})-f(z_{0})}{h_{n}}
            \end{equation}
            Checking differentiability using only the definition is far more
            straight forward for real-valued functions than in the complex
            setting. There are only two directions one may approach a real
            number, from the left or from the right. There are infinitely
            many directions to approach a fixed complex number from, which
            dramatically increases the difficulty. The
            \textbf{Cauchy-Riemann equations} are the primary tool used to
            overcome this hurdle. First note that for a function
            $f:\mathbb{C}\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$, given a complex number
            $z=x+iy$, the output $f(x+iy)$ is also a complex number, meaning
            there are real-valued functions $u$ and $v$ such that:
            \begin{equation}
                f(x+iy)=u(x,\,y)+iv(x,\,y)
            \end{equation}
            We may think of $u$ and $v$ as \textit{surfaces}, functions
            $F:\mathbb{R}^{2}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$. Given such a function
            $F$ we may define the \textbf{directional derivative} with respect
            to a non-zero vector $\mathbf{e}\in\mathbb{R}^{2}$ at a fixed point
            $\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^{2}$ via:
            \begin{equation}
                \nabla_{\mathbf{e}}(F)
                =\lim_{h\rightarrow{0}}
                \frac{F(\mathbf{x}+h\mathbf{e})-F(\mathbf{x})}{h}
            \end{equation}
            This measures the \textit{slope} of the surface in the $\mathbf{e}$
            direction. Since $h$ is a purely real non-zero quantity, and since
            $F(\mathbf{x}+h\mathbf{e})$ and $F(\mathbf{x})$ are real numbers,
            this is the quotient of two real numbers, meaning
            $\nabla_{\mathbf{e}}(F)$ is well-defined
            (provided the limit exists).
            \par\hfill\par
            Suppose we set $\mathbf{e}=\hat{\mathbf{x}}=(1,\,0)$, the unit
            vector in the positive $x$ direction. This becomes:
            \begin{equation}
                \begin{array}{rcl}
                    \displaystyle
                    \nabla_{\hat{\mathbf{x}}}(F)
                    &=&
                    \displaystyle
                    \lim_{h\rightarrow{0}}
                    \frac{F(\mathbf{x}+h\hat{\mathbf{x}})-F(\mathbf{x})}{h}
                    \\[2em]
                    &=&
                    \displaystyle
                    \frac{F(x+h,\,y)-F(x,\,y)}{h}
                \end{array}
            \end{equation}
            That is, we vary the $x$ component but keep $y$ fixed. We call this
            the \textbf{partial derivative} of $F$ with respect to $x$ and
            write:
            \begin{equation}
                \frac{\partial{F}}{\partial{x}}
                =\nabla_{\hat{\mathbf{x}}}(F)
            \end{equation}
            We may perform a similar operation with $\hat{\mathbf{y}}=(0,\,1)$,
            we write:
            \begin{equation}
                \frac{\partial{F}}{\partial{y}}
                =\nabla_{\hat{\mathbf{y}}}(F)
            \end{equation}
            Given a complex function $f:\mathbb{C}\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$,
            the Cauchy-Riemann equations relate the partial derivatives
            of $u$ and $v$ with respect to $x$ and $y$ to one another.
            The key theorem goes as follows.
            \begin{theorem}[\textbf{Cauchy-Riemann}]
                If $f:\mathbb{C}\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$ is given by
                $f(x+iy)=u(x,\,y)+iv(x,\,y)$ where
                $u,v:\mathbb{R}^{2}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ both have partial
                derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$, and such that
                the partial derivatives are continuous in both variables,
                then $f$ is (complex) differentiable if and only if
                the following equations hold:
                \begin{equation}
                    \begin{array}{rcl}
                        \displaystyle
                        \frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{x}}
                        &=&
                        \displaystyle
                        \phantom{+}
                        \frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{y}}\\[2em]
                        \displaystyle
                        \frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{y}}
                        &=&
                        \displaystyle
                        -\frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{x}}
                    \end{array}
                \end{equation}

        \subsection{Harmonic Functions}
            One of the surprising facts about the Cauchy-Riemann equations
            is that they reduce complex differentiation, with respect to a
            complex variable, down to \textit{real} partial differentiations
            with respect to a real variable. The is deeply connected to many
            areas of mathematics, in particular the study of partial
            differential equations. The Laplace equation is given by:
            \begin{equation}
                \nabla^{2}(\varphi)
                =\frac{\partial^{2}\varphi}{\partial{x}^{2}}
                +\frac{\partial^{2}\varphi}{\partial{y}^{2}}
                =0
            \end{equation}
            A solution $\varphi:\mathbb{R}^{2}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is called
            a \textbf{harmonic function}. Harmonic functions and complex
            differentiable ones are very closely related. For suppose
            $\varphi$ is harmonic and define:
            \begin{equation}
                g(x+iy)
                =\frac{\partial\varphi}{\partial{x}}(x,\,y)
                -i\frac{\partial\varphi}{\partial{y}}(x,\,y)
            \end{equation}
            That is, $u=\partial\varphi/\partial{x}$ and
            $v=-\partial\varphi/\partial{y}$.
            Then $g$ satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations since:
            \begin{equation}
                \begin{array}{rcll}
                    \displaystyle
                    \frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{x}}
                    &=&
                    \displaystyle
                    \frac{\partial^{2}\varphi}{\partial{x}^{2}}
                    &
                    \textrm{(Definition of $u$)}\\[2em]
                    &=&
                    \displaystyle
                    -\frac{\partial^{2}\varphi}{\partial{y}^{2}}
                    &
                    \textrm{(Since $\varphi$ is harmonic)}\\[2em]
                    &=&
                    \displaystyle
                    \frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{y}}
                    &
                    \textrm{(Definition of $v$)}
                \end{array}
            \end{equation}
            And so the first Cauchy-Riemann equation is satisfied. Similarly,
            so is the second:
            \begin{equation}
                \begin{array}{rcll}
                    \displaystyle
                    \frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{y}}
                    &=&
                    \displaystyle
                    \frac{\partial^{2}\varphi}{\partial{y}\partial{x}}
                    &
                    \textrm{(Definition of $u$)}\\[2em]
                    &=&
                    \displaystyle
                    \frac{\partial^{2}\varphi}{\partial{x}\partial{y}}
                    &
                    \textrm{(Clairaut's Theorem)}\\[2em]
                    &=&
                    \displaystyle
                    -\frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{x}}
                    &
                    \textrm{(Definition of $v$)}
                \end{array}
            \end{equation}
            Flipping this, if $u$ and $v$ satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann
            equations, then both $u$ and $v$ are harmonic. The tools used to
            prove the Cauchy-Riemann theorem are those of real analysis, and
            not complex.
    \section{Sketch of Proof}
        The forward direction is relatively simple. That is, if
        $f:\mathbb{C}\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$ is differentiable, then the
        Cauchy-Riemann equations must be true. Differentiability at a point
        $z_{0}\in\mathbb{C}$ means that regardless of the path one takes to
        $z_{0}$, the difference quotient has a well-defined limit. This is
        a very strong assumption. The Cauchy-Riemann equations appear once we
        consider a path of purely real numbers and a path of purely imaginary
        ones. That is, given $h:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ with
        $h_{n}\rightarrow{0}$ and $h_{n}\ne{0}$, we have:
        \begin{equation}
            \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}
            \frac{f\big((x+h_{n})+iy)-f(x+iy)}{h_{n}}
            =
            \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}
            \frac{f\big(x+i(y+h_{n}))-f(x+iy)}{ih_{n}}
        \end{equation}
        By replacing $f$ with $u$ and $v$ we see $x$ partial derivatives on
        the left and $y$ partial derivatives on the right. We compare the
        real and imaginary parts and are done.
        \par\hfill\par
        The converse is signficantly trickier. We must consider
        \textit{arbitrary} sequences that converge to zero, not just purely
        real or purely complex ones. The trick to overcoming this difficulty
        lies in real analysis.
        \subsection{The Mean Value Theorem}
            Suppose you are driving a car from Boston to New York City.
            This is roughly 215 miles, and suppose you complete the trip
            in 2 hours and 30 minutes. The ratio of displacement over time
            is $86$ miles per hour. The mean value theorem tells us that
            so long as you drove in a sufficiently smooth path, than at some
            point you were most definitely speeding. That is, there some some
            moment in time where your speed was precisely $86$ miles per hour.
            Formally, we have the following:
            \begin{theorem}[\textbf{Mean Value Theorem}]
                If $f:[a,\,b]\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is continuous, and
                differentiable at each point $x\in(a,\,b)$, then there is a
                point $c\in(a,\,b)$ such that:
                \begin{equation}
                    f^{\prime}(c)=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}
                \end{equation}
                That is, there is a point where the tangent line of $f$ has
                the same slope as the secant line across the interval.
            \end{theorem}
            For the latter direction (Cauchy-Riemann implies differentiable)
            we use the mean value theorem to somehow get the partial
            derivatives of $u$ and $v$ into the playing field. Note that if
            $y$ is fixed, then the mean value theorem applies to $u$ as $x$
            varies across $(x+h,\,y)$ and $(x,\,y)$. The mean value theorem
            then says there is some $h^{\prime}$ between $0$ and $h$ such
            that
            \begin{equation}
                u(x+h,\,y)-u(x,\,y)
                =h\frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{x}}
                (x+h^{\prime},\,y)
            \end{equation}
            A similar idea applies to the $y$ direction and to the function $v$.
    \section{Proof of the Cauchy-Riemann Theorem}
        We now prove the crucial main theorem, providing a necessary and
        sufficient condition of differentiability.
        \begin{theorem}[\textbf{The Cauchy-Riemann Equations: Part 1}]
            If $f:\mathbb{C}\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$ is given by
            $f(x+iy)=u(x,\,y)+iv(x,\,y)$, and if $f$ is differentiable, then
            the Cauchy-Riemann equations are satisfied:
            \begin{equation}
                \begin{array}{rcl}
                    \displaystyle
                    \frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{x}}
                    &=&
                    \displaystyle
                    \phantom{+}
                    \frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{y}}\\[1.5em]
                    \displaystyle
                    \frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{y}}
                    &=&
                    \displaystyle
                    -\frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{x}}
                \end{array}
            \end{equation}
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            If $f:\mathbb{C}\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$ is differentiable,
            then letting $h\rightarrow{0}$ using solely real numbers produces:
            \begin{equation}
                \begin{array}{rcl}
                    \displaystyle
                    f^{\prime}(z)
                    &=&
                    \displaystyle
                    \lim_{h\rightarrow{0}}
                    \frac{f(z+h)-f(z)}{h}\\[1.5em]
                    \displaystyle
                    &=&
                    \displaystyle
                    \lim_{h\rightarrow{0}}
                    \frac{u(x+h,\,y)+iv(x+h,\,y)-u(x,\,y)-iv(x,\,y)}{h}\\[1.5em]
                    \displaystyle
                    &=&
                    \displaystyle
                    \lim_{h\rightarrow{0}}
                    \frac{u(x+h,\,y)-u(x,\,y)}{h}
                    +i\lim_{h\rightarrow{0}}
                        \frac{v(x+h,\,y)-v(x,\,y)}{h}\\[1.5em]
                    &=&
                    \displaystyle
                    \frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{x}}
                        +i\frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{x}}
                \end{array}
            \end{equation}
            Replacing $h$ with $ih$, we allow this quantity to approach zero
            using purely imaginary numbers. We obtain:
            \begin{equation}
                \begin{array}{rcl}
                    \displaystyle
                    f^{\prime}(z)
                    &=&
                    \displaystyle
                    \lim_{h\rightarrow{0}}
                    \frac{f(z+ih)-f(z)}{ih}\\[1.5em]
                    \displaystyle
                    &=&
                    \displaystyle
                    \lim_{h\rightarrow{0}}
                    \frac{u(x,\,y+h)+iv(x,\,y+h)-u(x,\,y)-iv(x,\,y)}{ih}\\[1.5em]
                    \displaystyle
                    &=&
                    \displaystyle
                    \lim_{h\rightarrow{0}}
                    \frac{u(x,\,y+h)-u(x,\,y)}{ih}
                    +i\lim_{h\rightarrow{0}}
                        \frac{v(x,\,y+h)-v(x,\,y)}{ih}\\[1.5em]
                    &=&
                    \displaystyle
                    -i\frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{y}}
                        +\frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{y}}
                \end{array}
            \end{equation}
            Since the function is differentiable, the limit is independent of
            the path to zero. Equating we get:
            \begin{equation}
                \frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{x}}
                +i\frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{x}}
                =
                \frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{y}}
                -i\frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{y}}
            \end{equation}
            Comparing the real and imaginary parts of both sides
            produces the Cauchy-Riemann equations.
        \end{proof}
        The latter part is harder, but fortunately it is mostly bookkeeping.
        We invoke the mean value theorem, apply the Cauchy-Riemann equations,
        and then show that the function must then be differentiable.
        \begin{theorem}[\textbf{The Cauchy-Riemann Equations: Part 2}]
            If $f:\mathbb{C}\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$ is given by
            $f(x+iy)=u(x,\,y)+iv(x,\,y)$ and if $u$ and $v$ both have
            continuous partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$,
            and if the Cauchy-Riemann equations are satisfied, then $f$ is
            complex differentiable.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            For let $h:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$ be a sequence
            that converges to $0$ with $h_{n}\ne{0}$ for all $n$.
            For each $n\in\mathbb{N}$ we may write $h_{n}=a_{n}+ib_{n}$
            with $a_{n},b_{n}\in\mathbb{R}$. We have:
            \begin{equation}
                \begin{array}{rcl}
                    \displaystyle
                    \frac{f(z+h_{n})-f(z)}{h_{n}}
                    &=&
                    \displaystyle
                    \frac{f(z+h_{n})-f(z+a_{n})+f(z+a_{n})-f(z)}{h_{n}}\\[1.5em]
                    &=&
                    \displaystyle
                    \frac{f(z+h_{n})-f(z+a_{n})}{h_{n}}
                        +\frac{f(z+a_{n})-f(z)}{h_{n}}
                \end{array}
            \end{equation}
            Using $f(x+iy)=u(x,\,y)+iv(x,\,y)$, this final expression splits
            into two equations, one for $u$ and one for $v$. Concentrating
            on the real part of the equation ($u$), we get:
            \begin{equation}
                \label{eqn:u_difference_quotient}
                \frac{u(x+a_{n},\,y+b_{n})-u(x,\,y)}{h_{n}}
                =
                \frac{u(x+a_{n},\,y+b_{n})-u(x+a_{n},\,y)}{h_{n}}
                    +\frac{u(x+a_{n},\,y)-u(x,\,y)}{h_{n}}
            \end{equation}
            By the mean value theorem there is some real number
            ${b}_{n}^{\prime}$ between $0$ and $b_{n}$ such that:
            \begin{equation}
                u(x+a_{n},\,y+b_{n})-u(x+a_{n},\,y)
                =\frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{y}}
                \left(x+a_{n},\,y+b_{n}^{\prime}\right)b_{n}
            \end{equation}
            Similarly there is a real number $a_{n}^{\prime}$ between $0$ and
            $a_{n}$ such that:
            \begin{equation}
                u(x+a_{n},\,y)-u(x,\,y)
                =\frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{x}}
                \left(x+a_{n}^{\prime},\,y\right)a_{n}
            \end{equation}
            Plugging these two expressions into
            Eqn.~\ref{eqn:u_difference_quotient}, we obtain:
            \begin{equation}
                \label{eqn:u_mvt}
                \frac{u(x+a_{n},\,y+b_{n})-u(x,\,y)}{h_{n}}
                =\frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{y}}
                \left(x+a_{n},\,y+b_{n}^{\prime}\right)\frac{b_{n}}{h_{n}}
                +\frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{x}}
                \left(x+a_{n}^{\prime},\,y\right)\frac{a_{n}}{h_{n}}
            \end{equation}
            Similarly for $v$ there are numbers $a_{n}^{\prime\prime}$ and
            $b_{n}^{\prime\prime}$ between $0$ and $a_{n}$ and $b_{n}$,
            respectively, such that:
            \begin{equation}
                \label{eqn:v_mvt}
                \frac{v(x+a_{n},\,y+b_{n})-v(x,\,y)}{h_{n}}
                =\frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{y}}
                \left(x+a_{n},\,y+b_{n}^{\prime\prime}\right)
                \frac{b_{n}}{h_{n}}
                +\frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{x}}
                \left(x+a_{n}^{\prime\prime},\,y\right)
                \frac{a_{n}}{h_{n}}
            \end{equation}
            By hypothesis $u$ and $v$ satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations,
            and hence:
            \begin{equation}
                \label{eqn:cauchy_riemann_with_mvt}
                \begin{array}{rclr}
                    \displaystyle
                    \frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{x}}
                    \left(x+a_{n},\,y+b_{n}^{\prime\prime}\right)

            Define $U_{n}$ and $V_{n}$ as follows:
            \begin{equation}
                \begin{array}{rcl}
                    U_{n}
                    &=&
                    \displaystyle

                        -

                    \right)
                    \frac{ib_{n}}{h_{n}}\\[2em]
                    V_{n}
                    &=&
                    \displaystyle
                    \left(
                        \frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{x}}
                        (x+a_{n},\,y+b_{n}^{\prime\prime})
                        -
                        \frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{x}}
                        (x+a_{n}^{\prime\prime},\,y)
                    \right)
                    \frac{ib_{n}}{h_{n}}
                \end{array}
            \end{equation}
            The difference quotient is then:
            \begin{equation}
                \frac{f(z+h_{n})-f(z)}{h_{n}}
                =\frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{x}}
                    (x+a_{n}^{\prime},\,y)
                    \frac{a+ib_{n}}{h_{n}}
                +i\frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{x}}
                    (x+a_{n}^{\prime\prime},\,y)
                    \frac{a+ib_{n}}{h_{n}}
                +U_{n}+V_{n}
            \end{equation}
            But $h_{n}=a_{n}+ib_{n}$ by definition, and hence:
            \begin{equation}
                \frac{f(z+h_{n})-f(z)}{h_{n}}
                =\frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{x}}
                    (x+a_{n}^{\prime},\,y)
                +i\frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{x}}
                    (x+a_{n}^{\prime\prime},\,y)
                +U_{n}+V_{n}
            \end{equation}
            Since $h_{n}\rightarrow{0}$ we may conclude that
            $a_{n}\rightarrow{0}$ and $b_{n}\rightarrow{0}$ as well.
            But $a_{n}^{\prime}$ and $a_{n}^{\prime\prime}$ are wedged between
            $0$ and $a_{n}$, and hence these sequences must converge to $0$
            as well. A similar statement applies to $b_{n}^{\prime}$ and
            $b_{n}^{\prime\prime}$.
            If we take the limit as $n\rightarrow\infty$, then since
            $u$ and $v$ are continuously differentiable, the partial
            derivatives are continuous, hence:
            \begin{equation}
                \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}
                \left(
                    \frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{x}}
                    (x+a_{n}^{\prime},\,y)
                    +i\frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{x}}
                    (x+a_{n}^{\prime\prime},\,y)
                    +U_{n}+V_{n}
                \right)
                =\frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{x}}(x,\,y)
                +i\frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{x}}(x,\,y)
                +\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left(U_{n}+V_{n}\right)
            \end{equation}
            Now note that by the definition of $h_{n}$, for all $n$ we have
            $|b_{n}/h_{n}|\leq{1}$. Thus from continuity and the definition
            of $U_{n}$ (and since $a_{n}^{\prime}$ and $b_{n}^{\prime\prime}$
            both converge to zero) we have $U_{n}\rightarrow{0}$.
            That is:
            \begin{equation}
                \begin{array}{rcl}

                    0
                \end{array}
            \end{equation}
            Similarly $V_{n}\rightarrow{0}$, and therefore:
            \begin{equation}
                \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}
                \frac{f(z+h_{n})-f(z)}{h_{n}}

                +i\frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{x}}(x,\,y)
            \end{equation}
            Thus, $f$ is differentiable.
