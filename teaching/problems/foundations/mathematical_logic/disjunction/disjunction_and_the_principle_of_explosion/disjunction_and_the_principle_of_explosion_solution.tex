\begin{solution}
    The truth table for logical or, also called \textit{disjunction},
    which is represented by $\lor$ is given in
    Tab.~\ref{tab:disjunction_and_the_principle_of_explosion_solution}. We see
    that $P$ \textit{or} $Q$ is false only when both $P$ and $Q$ are both
    false simultaneously. Since we have a statement $P$ and we are told
    $P$ is true, regardless of the statement $Q$ we may conclude that
    $P$ \textit{or} $Q$ is a true sentence. Using the notation of
    mathematical logic, we have that $P\lor{Q}$ is true.
    \par\hfill\par
    Now we suppose also that $P$ is false. Again appealing to the truth
    table, since $P\lor{Q}$ is a true statement, and since $P$ is a false
    statement, $Q$ must also be a true statement (otherwise
    $P\lor{Q}$ would be false since both $P$ and $Q$ are false). Therefore
    if $P$ is a statement that is both true and false, and if $Q$ is any
    statement, then $Q$ is true.
