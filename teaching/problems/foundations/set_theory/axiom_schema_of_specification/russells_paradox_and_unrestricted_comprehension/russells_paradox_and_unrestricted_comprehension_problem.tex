\begin{problem}
    Here you will explore some set theory. You will prove that the
    \textit{axiom of unrestricted comprehension} is inconsistent. The axiom
    allows you to construct a set arbitrarily using any sentence. That is,
    if $P(x)$ is a sentence, you may collect all $x$ such that $P(x)$ is
    true. You could write:

    \begin{equation}
        A
        =
        \left\{\,
            x\;\big|\;
            P(x)\,
        \right\}
    \end{equation}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item
            (1 Point)
            Let $P(x)$ be the sentence $x$ \textit{is a set}.
            Let $A$ be the set $A=\{\,x\;|\;P(x)\,\}$. That is:

            \begin{equation}
                A
                =
                \left\{\,
                    x\;\big|\;
                    x\textrm{ is a set}\,
                \right\}
            \end{equation}

            Describe the set $A$. Is it true that $A\in{A}$?
        \item
            (2 Points)
            Let $B$ be the set

            \begin{equation}
                B
                =
                \left\{\,
                    x\in{A}\;\big|\;
                    x\notin{x}\,
                \right\}
            \end{equation}

            Prove that $B\in{B}$.
        \item
            (2 Points)
            Now prove that $B\notin{B}$.
        \item
            (1 Point)
            Why should we not accept the axiom of
            unrestricted comprehension as true?
    \end{itemize}
\end{problem}
