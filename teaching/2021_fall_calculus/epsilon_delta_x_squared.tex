    \maketitle
    The definition of continuity is as follows:
    \begin{definition}
        A real-valued function that is continuous at a point
        $x_{0}\in\mathbb{R}$ is a function $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$
        such that for all $\varepsilon>0$ there exists a $\delta>0$ such that
        for all $x\in\mathbb{R}$ with $|x-x_{0}|<\delta$ it is true that
        $|f(x)-f(x_{0})|<\varepsilon$.
    \end{definition}
    Let's prove $f(x)=x^{2}$ is continuous for all real numbers. Let's first
    work out $x_{0}=0$ so we can avoid any annoying divisions by zero that may
    occur in our work. For $x_{0}=0$, we have:
    \begin{equation}
        \textbf{Want:}\quad
        |x-0|<\delta
        \Rightarrow|x^{2}-0|<\varepsilon
    \end{equation}
    Simplifying, we want $|x|<\delta$ implies $|x|^{2}<\varepsilon$. If we
    choose $\delta=\sqrt{\varepsilon}$, we'd be done since
    $|x|<\delta$ implies $|x|<\sqrt{\varepsilon}$, which then implies
    $|x|^{2}<\varepsilon$.
    \par\hfill\par
    Now let's prove $f(x)=x^{2}$ is continuous at any non-zero value. We have
    the following:
    \begin{equation}
        \textbf{Want:}\quad
        |x-x_{0}|<\delta
        \Rightarrow|x^{2}-x_{0}^{2}|<\varepsilon
    \end{equation}
    Factoring this expression on the right, we can rephrase this:
    \begin{equation}
        \textbf{Want:}\quad
        |x-x_{0}|<\delta
        \Rightarrow
        |x-x_{0}||x+x_{0}|<\varepsilon
    \end{equation}
    Since we will only look at $x$ values satisfying $|x-x_{0}|<\delta$,
    we have:
    \begin{equation}
        |x-x_{0}||x+x_{0}|<\delta|x+x_{0}|
    \end{equation}
    If we can make $\delta|x+x_{0}|\leq\varepsilon$ we'd be done, since:
    \begin{equation}
        |x^{2}-x_{0}^{2}|=|x-x_{0}||x+x_{0}|
        <\delta|x+x_{0}|\leq\varepsilon
    \end{equation}
    So, how do we make $\delta|x+x_{0}|\leq\varepsilon$ a reality? The
    expression $\delta|x+x_{0}|\leq\varepsilon$ is \textbf{not} always true
    since $|x+x_{0}|$ gets arbitrarily large as $x$ gets bigger. But we don't
    care about larger and larger values of $x$, we only care about values of
    $x$ that are close to $x_{0}$. So let's suppose we only look at values that
    are no more than $|x_{0}|/2$ away from $x_{0}$. That is, we are introducing
    the restriction that $\delta\leq|x_{0}|/2$. If this were true, the largest
    $|x+x_{0}|$ could be is $5|x_{0}|/2$. To see this, we invoke the
    \textit{triangle inequality} that says for any real numbers $a$ and $b$,
    the following is true:
    \begin{equation}
        |a+b|\leq|a|+|b|
    \end{equation}
    Applying this to $a=x_{0}$ and $b=x_{0}\pm{x}_{0}/2$, we'd get:
    \begin{equation}
        |x+x_{0}|\leq|x|+|x_{0}|\leq|3x_{0}/2|+|x_{0}|=5|x_{0}|/2
    \end{equation}
    If we choose $\delta$ such that $5|x_{0}|\delta/2\leq\varepsilon$ we'd be
    done. It is tempting to write \textit{choose}
    $\delta=2\varepsilon/5|x_{0}|$, but remember we've already imposed the
    restriction that $\delta\leq|x_{0}|/2$. We must choose the smaller of these
    two.
    \par\hfill\par
    We now have a candidate for $\delta$. Let's show that it works. Let
    $\varepsilon>0$. Choose $\delta=\min(|x_{0}|/2,2\varepsilon/5|x_{0}|)$. If
    $|x-x_{0}|<\delta$, then $|x-x_{0}|<\min(|x_{0}|/2,2\varepsilon/5|x_{0}|)$.
    But if $|x-x_{0}|<\min(|x_{0}|/2,2\varepsilon/5|x_{0}|)$, then
    $|x-x_{0}|<2\varepsilon/5|x_{0}|$ by the definition of $\min$. But then
    $\frac{5|x_{0}|}{2}|x-x_{0}|<\varepsilon$. But since
    $|x-x_{0}|<\min(|x_{0}|/2,2\varepsilon/5|x_{0}|)$, we have
    $|x-x_{0}|<|x_{0}|/2$ by the definition of $\min$. But if
    $|x-x_{0}|<|x_{0}|/2$, then $|x+x_{0}|<5|x_{0}|/2$. But then
    $|x+x_{0}||x-x_{0}|<\frac{5|x_{0}|}{2}|x-x_{0}|<\varepsilon$. But
    $|x+x_{0}||x-x_{0}|=|x^{2}-x_{0}^{2}|$. Therefore
    $|x^{2}-x_{0}^{2}|<\varepsilon$.
