    \maketitle
    If $f:A\rightarrow{B}$ is a function that takes in elements from $A$ and
    returns elements in $B$, it is possible for there to be another function
    $g:B\rightarrow{A}$ that takes in elements from $B$ and returns elements
    in $A$ with the property that for all $a\in{A}$ it is true that
    $g(f(a))=a$ and for all $b\in{B}$ it is true that $f(g(b))=b$. Such a
    function is called the \textit{inverse} of $f$, and is often denoted
    $g=f^{-1}$. There are two conditions for an inverse to exist. First,
    if $a_{0}$ and $a_{1}$ are elements of $A$, and if $f(a_{0})=f(a_{1})$,
    then $a_{0}=a_{1}$. To see why this is required, suppose we have a function
    like $f(x)=x^{2}$, and suppose we ask what should the inverse function do
    at the value 1. Should $f^{-1}(1)=1$ or should it be $-1$? Both have the
    property that they square to 1 since $1^{2}=1$ and $(-1)^{2}=1$. To
    prevent the inverse from being ambiguous, $f$ must be
    \textit{one-to-one}, also known as \textit{injective}. This is precisely
    the statement that $f(a_{0})=f(a_{1})$ implies $a_{0}=a_{1}$. Secondly,
    every element $b\in{B}$ must have some other element $a\in{A}$ such that
    $f(a)=b$. Again consider $f(x)=x^{2}$. What should the inverse of $-1$ be?
    There is no real number such that $x^{2}=-1$, so we have an undefined
    value for our inverse function. Functions satisfying this second property
    are said to be \textit{onto}, but also called \textit{surjective}. So, for
    an inverse to exist we need the function to be
    \textit{injective} and \textit{surjective}. These two properties occur
    together so frequently in mathematics that they are given a new name. A
    \textit{bijective} function is a function that is both \textit{injective}
    and \textit{surjective}. The function $f(x)=x^{2}$, when viewed as a
    function $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$, is neither injective nor
    surjective.
    \par\hfill\par
    It is often possible to restrict the domain and target of the function
    so that it then becomes bijective. For example, if we only consider
    $f:\mathbb{R}_{\geq{0}}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}_{\geq{0}}$, where I've used
    the notation $\mathbb{R}_{\geq{0}}$ to mean all real numbers greater than
    or equal to zero, then $f(x)=x^{2}$ \textit{is} bijective. Every
    non-negative real number squares to a unique number, and every non-negative
    real number is the square of a unique non-negative real number. This allows
    us to define the square root $f^{-1}(x)=\sqrt{x}$ which is the inverse
    of our original function $f(x)=x^{2}$. Both $f$ and $f^{-1}$ are
    shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:x2_and_sqrt_x}. A crucial feature to note is that
    $\sqrt{x}$ is the \textit{reflection} of $x^{2}$ across the line $y=x$.
    This is true of inverse functions and gives us a means of plotting them,
    even if we can't find nice formulas.
