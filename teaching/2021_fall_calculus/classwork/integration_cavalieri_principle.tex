    \maketitle
    Cavalieri's principle states the following:
    If two plane regions are bounded between two lines, and if for every
    horizontal line the intersection of this line with the first plane
    region has the same length as the intersection of this line with the
    second plane region, then both regions have the same area.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item
        Suppose we have a stack of coins where every coin is directly on top of
        the previous one. If we perturb the coins a bit so they do not sit
        evenly on top of each other, does the total volume of all of the coins
        change?
        \item
        Let's prove Cavalieri's principle with calculus. If
        $f,g:[a,b]\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ are continuous functions, how can we
        express the \textit{area between} $f$ \textit{and} $g$?
        \item
        If $h:[a,b]\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is continuous, and if
        $F,G:[a,b]\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ are defined by
        $F(x)=f(x)+h(x)$ and $G(x)=g(x)+h(x)$, what is the area between $F$
        and $G$?
        \item
        Prove your formula using the rules of integration.
    \end{enumerate}
