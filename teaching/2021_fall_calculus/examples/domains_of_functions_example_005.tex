    \maketitle
    Consider the following function:
    \begin{equation}
        f(x)=\frac{\sin(x)}{x}
    \end{equation}
    This function is well defined everywhere except for $x=0$. However, the
    \textit{small angle approximation}, often used by physicists, states that
    if $x$ is a small real number, then $\sin(x)\approx{x}$. The symbol
    $\approx$ means \textit{is approximately equal to}. We can verify this
    from the graph of the two functions close to the origin. By examining
    Fig.~\ref{fig:small_angle_approx} we see that for small values the graphs
    of $\sin(x)$ and $x$ are nearly identical. Using this we have, for
    small $x$, the following:
    \begin{equation}
        \frac{\sin(x)}{x}\approx\frac{x}{x}=1
    \end{equation}
    And indeed the \textit{limit} of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches zero is 1, even
    though $f(0)$ is undefined. With this we can define a new function by
    \textit{filling in} where $f(x)$ is undefined. This is the
    \textit{sinc} function, and it's use is widespread in physics, engineering,
    and signal processing.
    \begin{equation}
        \textrm{sinc}(x)=
        \begin{cases}
            \frac{\sin(x)}{x},&x\ne{0}\\
            1,&x=0
        \end{cases}
    \end{equation}
    Since the limit of $\textrm{sinc}(x)$ as $x$ approaches zero is 1, and
    since $\textrm{sinc}(0)=1$, we have from the
    \textit{limit definition of continuity} that $\textrm{sinc}(x)$ is
    continuous at 0. This function is shown in
    Fig.~\ref{fig:sinc_x}.
