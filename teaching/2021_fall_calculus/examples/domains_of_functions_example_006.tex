    \maketitle
    Consider the expression:
    \begin{equation}
        f(x)=\frac{3x}{\frac{2}{x}-1}
    \end{equation}
    For what real numbers is this well-defined? The only thing to look out for
    is division by zero. The denominator is $2/x-1$, so if we are to avoid
    division by zero we must exclude $x=2$. The expression $2/x$ also
    contains a division, and so we must also exclude $x=0$. In set theory
    notation, we can write the domain as:
    \begin{equation}
        D=(-\infty,0)\cup(0,2)\cup(2,\infty)
    \end{equation}
    If we were to simplify, we get:
    \begin{align}
        f(x)&=\frac{3x}{\frac{2}{x}-1}\\
            &=\frac{x}{x}\cdot\frac{3x}{\frac{2}{x}-1}\\
            &=\frac{3x^{2}}{2-x}
    \end{align}
    And from this we can conclude that the \textit{limit} as $x$ approaches
    0 is 0. However, the simplification step involved multiplying by
    $\frac{x}{x}$ which is undefined for $x=0$. The function, as it was
    originally written, must exclude 0 from it's domain. This is
    plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig:graph_of_func}.
