    \maketitle
    The square root of a non-negative real number $x$ is the unique
    non-negative real number $y$ such that $x=y^{2}$. That such a number exists
    is not trivial, but requires concepts we don't currently have. We
    label this value $y=\sqrt{x}$, and the $\sqrt{\empty}$ symbol is called the
    \textit{radical}. By the very nature of this definition, we do not allow
    the input to be negative. Indeed, if we did, we could solve the equation
    $x^{2}+1=0$ via $\sqrt{-1}$, but there is no real number such that
    $x^{2}=-1$. Remember from the graph of the parabola that $x^{2}$ is
    always greater than or equal to zero. See
    Fig.~\ref{fig:x_squared} for a visual as to why $x^{2}$ is never negative,
    and Fig.~\ref{fig:x_squared_plus_one} for why $x^{2}+1=0$ has no real
    solution.

    Consider the following expression:
    \begin{equation}
        f(x)=\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{x-\sqrt{1-x}}
    \end{equation}
    There are several cases where $f(x)$ could fail to be well-defined. Firstly,
    we have a division and must ensure the denominator is non-zero. The
    expression $x-\sqrt{1-x}=0$ occurs when $x=\sqrt{1-x}$. Squaring both
    sides, we must avoid $x^{2}=1-x$, which is the same thing as avoiding
    $x^{2}+x-1=0$. Using the quadratic formula (with $a=1$, $b=1$, and
    $c=-1$), the solutions to this are:
    \begin{equation}
        x=\frac{-1\pm\sqrt{5}}{2}
    \end{equation}
    The numerator $\sqrt{2x}$ creates the restriction that $2x\geq{0}$, which
    is equivalent to requiring $x\geq{0}$. Because of this, we can rid ourselves
    of the requirement that $x\ne\frac{-1-\sqrt{5}}{2}$ since this value is
    negative and $x\geq{0}$ already excludes it. Thus far we need
    $x\geq{0}$ and $x\ne\frac{-1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$. The denominator also has the
    expression $\sqrt{1-x}$. We need the input to this to be non-negative, and
    thus require $1-x\geq{0}$. This implies $1\geq{x}$. All together we need
    $0\leq{x}\leq{1}$ and $x\ne\frac{-1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$. In set theory notation,
    the domain of $f$ is:
    \begin{equation}
        D=\Big[0,\frac{-1+\sqrt{5}}{2}\Big)\bigcup
        \Big(\frac{-1+\sqrt{5}}{2},1\Big]
    \end{equation}
    The function $f(x)=\sqrt{2x}/(x-\sqrt{1-x})$ is plotted in
    Fig.~\ref{fig:sqrt_2x_by_x_minus_sqrt_one_minus_x}.
