    \maketitle
    The definition of continuity is as follows:
    \begin{definition}
        A real-valued function that is continuous at a point
        $x_{0}\in\mathbb{R}$ is a function $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$
        such that for all $\varepsilon>0$ there exists a $\delta>0$ such that
        for all $x\in\mathbb{R}$ with $|x-x_{0}|<\delta$ it is true that
        $|f(x)-f(x_{0})|<\varepsilon$.
    \end{definition}
    Let's consider the following bizarre function:
    \begin{equation}
        f(x)=
        \begin{cases}
            x&x\in\mathbb{Q}\\
            -x&x\notin\mathbb{Q}
        \end{cases}
    \end{equation}
    The set $\mathbb{Q}$ is the set of \textit{rational numbers} of the
    form $x=p/q$ for integer $p$ and $q$ with $q\ne{0}$, so if
    $x\notin\mathbb{Q}$ (read \textit{$x$ is not in $\mathbb{Q}$}), then
    $x$ is irrational. So we have $f(x)=x$ for rational numbers and
    $f(x)=-x$ for irrational numbers. Two properties of the real number to
    note. First, between any two real numbers $a$ and $b$ with $a<b$ there is a
    rational number $x$ such that $a<x<b$. Second, for any two real numbers
    $a$ and $b$ with $a<b$ there is an irrational number $y$ such that $a<y<b$.
    Intuitively, the rationals and irrationals are densely distributed across
    the real number line. Using this, we have that if $x_{0}\ne{0}$, then
    $f$ is \textit{not} continuous at $x_{0}$. To see this, since the rational
    values give $f(x)=x$ and irrational numbers give $f(x)=-x$, in the region
    around $x_{0}$ there are jumps that are about $2x_{0}$ in height. But what
    would happen if we chose $x_{0}=0$?
    \par\hfill\par
    Claim: $f$ is continuous at $0$. Let's prove this. Like every
    $\varepsilon-\delta$ proof, we start with the statement
    \textit{let $\varepsilon>0$}. Choose $\delta=\varepsilon$. If
    $|x-0|<\delta$, then $|x|<\delta$ since $|x-0|=|x|$. But, since $f(0)=0$,
    and since $f(x)=\pm{x}$, depending on $x$, we have:
    \begin{equation}
        |f(x)-f(0)|=|f(x)|=|\pm{x}|=|x|<\delta=\varepsilon
    \end{equation}
    And therefore $|f(x)-f(0)|<\varepsilon$. That is, $f$ is continuous at 0.
    \par\hfill\par
    Now ask yourself, how could we prove that $f$ is continuous at $x=0$
    without the use of the $\varepsilon-\delta$ definition? There are other
    definitions of continuity (via \textit{sequences} and via
    \textit{open sets}) that are equivalent to the $\varepsilon-\delta$ but
    these are considerably more advanced and are reserved for courses like
    topology or metric spaces. So how, using what we know, would we
    prove $f$ is continuous at $x=0$? The answer is, without
    $\varepsilon-\delta$, we most likely can't. This function is so pathological
    that intuition doesn't help all that much and we need to resort to a
    rigorous definition that we can then apply to the problem. The graph
    of $f$ is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:graph_of_f}. This is a rough sketch of
    the function. The function itself is impossible to to draw since it has
    infinitely many jumps and computers can't render that. But this picture
    suffices for intuition.
