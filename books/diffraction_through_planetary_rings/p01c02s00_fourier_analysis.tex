\chapter{Fourier Analysis}
    Fourier analysis is deeply tied to the theory of integration, and as such
    it is worth while to develop a few of the basic elements of this field.
    Many of theorems we wish to use, such as the \textit{convolution theorem},
    \textit{Fubini's theorem}, and the \textit{Fourier inversion theorem},
    are often presented with hand-wavy ``proofs,'' that obscure some of the
    problems that arise when applying these results to real-world problems. We
    will not dive into the entirety of measure theory, but rather present the
    elementary definitions, provide examples, and move on to the
    more important theorems.
