\chapter{Special Functions}
    There are many special functions that arise in diffraction
    theory. These are functions that can not be written in
    closed form via a combination of rational functions,
    trigonometric functions, logarithms, or exponentials.
    Usually such functions are defined as the solution to
    a particular differential equation, such as Bessel
    functions, or as the result of integrating a non-trivial
    function, such as Fresnel Integrals. Other times functions
    are defined as the inverse of a tricky algebraic equation,
    such that the Lambert $W$ function. We'll discuss these
    three functions, numerical calculations, and their
    applications.
