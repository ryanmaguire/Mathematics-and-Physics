As we've seen, Khovanov homology is capable of detecting the
unknot, trefoils, and figure-eight knot and also that Khovanov homology with
coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ is capable of detecting
the cinquefoil knot \cite{BaldwinYingSivekCinquefoilKhovanov},
which is the $T(5,2)$ torus knot. We also know that the Jones
polynomial is \textit{not} capable of detecting the
$T(5,2)$ torus knot since the $10_{132}$ knot yields the same
polynomial (See Tab.~\ref{table:matching_torus_knots}).
These are the smallest of the known Legendrian simple knots
and we now try to provide numerical evidence for the following.
\begin{conjecture}
    If a link type $L$ is Legendrian simple, then the Khovanov homology
    of $L$ distinguishes it. That is, if $\tilde{L}$
    is another link with the same Khovanov homology, then $\tilde{L}$ is
    equivalent to $L$.
\end{conjecture}
A tally is provided for torus knots against all prime knots up to 19 crossings.
There exist torus knots that have the same Jones polynomial as a non-torus
knot ($T(2,5)$ matches 10 and 17 crossing knots, $T(2,7)$
matches a 12 crossing knot, and $T(2,11)$ matches a 14 crossing knot)
so we cannot generalize the Jones unknot conjecture. Nevertheless, in
all cases the Khovanov homologies were different.

The computations were done as follows. There are libraries in Python,
Sage, and C++ for working with knot polynomials. In particular,
Regina \cite{regina}, SnapPy \cite{SnapPy}, the Sage knot library
\cite{sage}, and two of the authors C libraries
\cite{MaguireJones}, \cite{MaguireLibtmpl}.

We first gather the torus knots that could potentially have the same
Jones polynomial as some other knot based on the bounds of the degree.
The Jones polynomials of torus knots were computed using the
formula (from \cite{jonesfordummyvjones}):
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:jones_poly_torus}%
    J_{T_{m,\,n}}(q)=q^{(m-1)(n-1)/2}
        \frac{1-q^{m+1}-q^{n+1}+q^{m+n}}{1-q^{2}}
\end{equation}
The defining equation for the Kauffman bracket showed us that the degree of the
Jones polynomial of an $N$ crossing knot will be bounded by $4N+1$. That is,
the Kauffman bracket contains a sum over terms $(-q)^{w(n)}(q+q^{-1})^{c(n)}$.
The Hamming weight $w(n)$ is bounded by $N$, and the circle counting
function is bounded by $N+1$. The Jones normalization involves a $2N$ term,
and hence the Jones polynomial is no larger than $4N+1$.

    \caption{Arbitrary Co-Prime Pairs}
    \label{fig:gcd_plot}
\end{figure}
Since we are looking at knots up to $19$ crossings, we collect the
co-prime pairs $(m,\,n)$ with $1<m<n$ such that the degree of
$J_{T_{m,\,n}}(q)$
is less than $4\cdot{19}+1=77$. There are 57 such co-prime pairs.
Since the Jones polynomial of a mirror
can be computed by substituting $q\mapsto{q}^{-1}$ we need not look at
negative values. The Khovanov polynomial makes a similar change,
$(q,\,t)\mapsto(q^{-1},\,t^{-1})$ \cite{WATSON2017915}. We can envision this
collection of knots by creating a 78-by-78 grid of squares in the plane.
If the $(m,\,n)$ block satisfies the above conditions, color the pixel gray,
otherwise color it black. This is done in Fig.~\ref{fig:gcd_plot_torus_knots}.
Na\"{i}vely looking at all co-prime pairs with $\textrm{max}(m,\,n)\leq{77}$
produces Fig.~\ref{fig:gcd_plot},
containing significantly more points. We save a lot a lot of
computational time by using Eqn.~\ref{eqn:jones_poly_torus} to reduce the
number of co-prime pairs we need to examine, and by
invoking the symmetry of torus knots.

Of the aforementioned libraries regina had the best performance for the most
general knots.\footnote{%
    The sage implementation at the time of this writing uses a clever recursive
    trick that simplifies the computation via Type I and Type II moves as it
    goes. This yields a best case complexity of $O(N)$, for example when a
    twist knot is used. The worst case scenario is still
    $O(\textrm{poly}(N)\cdot{2}^{N})$ and this
    is made worse by the fact the spatial component is also
    $O(\textrm{poly}(N)\cdot{2}^{N})$ instead
    of $O(N)$ like the non-recursive methods.
}
This was used to compute the Jones polynomial of all prime knots of up to
19 crossings.\footnote{%
    The computation required about two and a half days.
}
If a knot outputted a polynomial that matched that of a torus
knot (using Eqn.~\ref{eqn:jones_poly_torus}) the alphabetical DT code of the
knot was saved in a text file for later examination. After computing the Jones
polynomial of all of our knots we look through the knots in our text file and
see which ones are indeed torus knots themselves. After discarding these
we end up with a total of 4 non-torus knots with the same Jones polynomial as a
torus knot (See Tab.~\ref{table:matching_torus_knots}).
Since the Khovanov polynomial reduces to the Jones polynomial after the
appropriate substitution
(recall $J_{L}(q)=Kh_{L}(q,-1)$) the only possible non-torus knots with
the same Khovanov homology as a torus knot were these 4.

Using the algorithm from \cite{BarNatan2006FASTKH}, which is implemented in
\cite{JavaKhv2}\footnote{
    This is Nikolay Pultsin's fork of the original JavaKh library, written by
    Jeremy Greene under the supervision of Dror Bar-Natan. The original version
    fails to compile on a modern GNU/Linux system. Pultsin made some changes
    that allow the library to work with OpenJDK-17.
}
we found that these four knots with the same Jones polynomials as some
torus knot all had different Khovanov homologies. Thus, we have the
following claim:
\begin{theorem}
    If a prime knot $K$ has less than or equal to 19 crossings and has
    the Khovanov homology of a torus knot $T$,
    then $K$ is equivalent to $T$.
\end{theorem}
A similar search through the twist knots yielded more results.
From our previous computation we know that the Jones polynomials of the twist
knots satisfy:
\begin{equation}
    J_{K_{n}}(q)=
    \begin{cases}
        (1+q^{-4}+q^{-2n}+q^{-2n-6})/(1+q^{2}),&n\textrm{ odd}\\
        (1+q^{2}-q^{6-2n}+q^{-2n})/(1+q^{2}),&n\textrm{ even}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
A search through all prime knots up to 19 crossings against twist knots
provided eleven matches for the Jones polynomial
(See Tab.~\ref{table:matching_twist_knots}), but
none for Khovanov homology. As mentioned all twist knots $m_{n}$ with
$n\geq{-3}$ are transversely simple
\cite{EtnyreEtAlLegendrianAndTransverseTwistKnots}, and hence we have evidence
for the following conjecture.
\begin{conjecture}
    If a link type $L$ is transversely simple, then the Khovanov
    homology of $L$ distinguishes it. That is, if $\tilde{L}$
    is another link with the same Khovanov homology, then $\tilde{L}$ is
    equivalent to $L$.
\end{conjecture}
In the following sections we present the computations for three types of knots:
torus, twist, and conjectured Legendrian simple knots
(see \cite{LegendrianKnotAtlas}). In every case Khovanov
homology seems able to completely distinguish these types of knots.
