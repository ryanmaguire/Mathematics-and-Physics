    In Tab.~\ref{table:matching_torus_knots}
    we have found four non-torus knots with the same
    Jones polynomial as some torus knot. In all four cases the Khovanov
    polynomials differ. The tables for these polynomials are given in
    Appendix A.
    The coefficient of $q^{\ell}t^{r}$ is given by the corresponding entry.
    Empty equates to zero.

    The cinquefoil $T(2,\,5)$ has the same Jones polynomial as two
    non-torus knots. As shown in
    Tabs.~\ref{table:t_2_5_kho}-\ref{table:iNHlPJqCoKFmdABgE_kho}, the
    Khovanov polynomials differ
    (This had already been known, see \cite{KatlasKhoHo}).
    Note the columns for the Euler characteristic $\chi$ are identical,
    indicating matching Jones polynomials.
    \par\hfill\par
    The $T(7,2)$ knot, also the $7_{1}$ knot, and occasionally called the
    septafoil, has the same Jones polynomial as \texttt{fJGkHlICEABd}. The
    Khovanov polynomials are distinct
    (Tabs.~\ref{table:t_7_2_kho}-\ref{table:fJGkHlICEABd_kho}).
    Lastly, the $T(11,2)$ torus knot has the same Jones polynomial as the
    14 crossing knot \texttt{gHlImJnKBDFAce}. Once again the Khovanov
    polynomials differ.
