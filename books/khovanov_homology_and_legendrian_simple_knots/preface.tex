This work examines some of the computational aspects of knot theory and
provides evidence for new conjectures in the field. In chapter 1 we discuss
some elementary background for knot theory, including several of the
computational methods of representing knots. The challenge of discerning knots
is then tackled in chapter 2 where we discuss knot invariants. Here we introduce
two new algorithms for the computation of the Jones polynomial, including a
new modification of the Tait graph for virtual knots. We also explore some
known ideas for the calculation of other invariants such as the Alexander and
HOMFLY-PT polynomials, as well as Khovanov homology. In chapter 3 we discuss
contact topology and Legendrian simple knots, and then get in to the heart of
the thesis in chapter 4 which contains the numerical work. Here we provide
support for the claim that Khovanov homology is able to distinguish Legendrian
and tranvserally simple knots using the family of torus and twist knots as
representatives, respectivelly. By brute force methods we are to prove that
the Khovanov polynomial, the Poincar\'{e} polynomial of Khovanov homology, is
able to distinguish torus and twist knots among all prime knots of up to 19
crossings, which amounds to more than 352 million knots. In the process of
performing these computations we have tallied several invariants for all
prime knots up to 19 crossings and these are now publically available.
