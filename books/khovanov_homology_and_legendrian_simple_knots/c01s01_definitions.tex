\section{Basic Definitions}
    Following \cite[p.~15]{LivingstonKnotTheory}, we define a knot as follows.
    \begin{definition}[\textbf{Knot}]
        A knot is a polygonal (piece-wise linear) embedding
        $\gamma:\mathbb{S}^{1}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{3}$ of the unit circle
        into three dimensional Euclidean space.
    \end{definition}
    A triangle serves as a polygonal example of the unknot, and the trefoil is
    given a polygonal embedding in Fig.~\ref{fig:trefoil_knot_polygonal}.
    \begin{figure}
        \centering
        \includegraphics{trefoil_knot_polygonal.pdf}
        \caption{Polygonal Trefoil Knot}
        \label{fig:trefoil_knot_polygonal}
    \end{figure}
    While it is possible to define knots using \textit{continuous} embeddings,
    such a definition provides for the existence of
    \textit{wild knots} \cite{FoxArtinWildKnots1948}.\footnote{%
        See \cite{BrowneWildKnots} for how to procedurally generate wild knots.
    }
    \textit{Smooth} embeddings can similarly be used, albeit at the expense of
    a slightly harder definition of \textit{knot equivalence}. In the polygonal
    case this comes with ease. Given a piece-wise linear embedding
    $\gamma:\mathbb{S}^{1}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{3}$ with vertices
    $P_{1},\,\dots,\,P_{n}$ we are allowed to deform $\gamma$ into a new
    embedding $\gamma'$ formed by the (ordered) vertices
    $P_{1},\,\dots,\,P_{n},\,P'$
    such that the triangle $\Delta{P}_{n}P'P_{1}$ (interior included)
    only intersects $\gamma$
    along the line segment $\overline{P_{1}P_{n}}$. This is called an
    \textbf{elementary knot equivalence}. With this we define equivalent knots.
    \begin{definition}[\textbf{Equivalent Knots}]
        Equivalent knots are polygonal embeddings
        $\gamma,\gamma':\mathbb{S}^{1}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{3}$ that differ by
        a finite number of elementary knot equivalences.
    \end{definition}
    Knot equivalence induces an equivalence relation on the set of all knots
    and the \textbf{knot type} of a knot
    $\gamma:\mathbb{S}^{1}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{3}$ is the equivalence class
    $K=[\gamma]$. Many texts do not distinguish between a knot and its knot
    type.
    \par\hfill\par
    While the polygonal definitions of knot and knot equivalence are perhaps
    the easiest to describe, it is also convenient to think of knots as smooth
    embeddings of $\mathbb{S}^{1}$ into $\mathbb{R}^{3}$. Indeed, most of the
    figures to follow will depict smooth knots. It is then fortunate that the
    two descriptions are equivalent for most purposes, and both exclude the
    existence of wild knots \cite[p.~147]{CrowellFoxKnotTheory}. As mentioned,
    the smooth setting has a more verbose definition of knot equivalence.
    Smooth embeddings $\gamma,\gamma':\mathbb{S}^{1}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{3}$
    are considered equivalent if there is an \textbf{ambient isotopy}
    between them, a smooth family of diffeomorphisms
    $H_{t}:\mathbb{R}^{3}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{3}$ such that
    $H_{0}|_{\mathbb{S}^{1}}=\gamma$ and $H_{1}|_{\mathbb{S}^{1}}=\gamma'$.%
    \footnote{%
        Here we take $\mathbb{S}^{1}\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{3}$
        to lie in the $xy$ plane.
    }
    \footnote{%
        The definition in \cite[p.~4]{CrowellFoxKnotTheory} only requires a
        single diffeomorphism $f:\mathbb{R}^{3}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{3}$ that
        takes the image of $\gamma$ to the image of $\gamma'$. Such a
        definition is unable to distinguish a knot from its \textit{mirror},
        the result of composing the knot with the reflection $z\mapsto{-z}$.
        If one requires $f$ be \textit{orientation preserving}, then the
        two definitions are equivalent.
    }
    \footnote{%
        By a \textit{smooth family} it is meant that the product map
        $H:\mathbb{R}^{3}\times[0,\,1]\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{3}$ defined by
        $H(\mathbf{x},\,t)=H_{t}(\mathbf{x})$ is smooth.
    }
    \par\hfill\par
    Explicit embeddings are rarely given for smooth or polygonal knots. Instead
    we often study knots via the use of \textbf{knot diagrams}. Given a knot
    $\gamma:\mathbb{S}^{1}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{3}$ and a vector
    $\mathbf{v}\in\mathbb{S}^{2}$, by composing $\gamma$ with the projection
    $\textrm{proj}_{\mathbf{v}}:\mathbb{R}^{3}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{2}$ we get
    a drawing in the plane. For a polygonal knot, a \textbf{regular} projection
    is one where for each $\mathbf{p}\in\mathbb{R}^{2}$ the pre-image consists
    of at most two points in $\mathbb{S}^{1}$, and such that vertices of
    $\gamma$ map to unique points in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$. For a smooth knot, a
    regular projection is again one such that the pre-image of each
    $\mathbf{p}\in\mathbb{R}^{2}$ consists of at most two points in
    $\mathbb{S}^{1}$, but also such that the resulting composition is an
    \textbf{immersion} from $\mathbb{S}^{1}$ into $\mathbb{R}^{2}$.
    \par\hfill\par
    For the general knot $\gamma$ and vector $\mathbf{v}\in\mathbb{S}^{2}$, the
    resulting projection may not be regular. Fortunately we have the following
    theorem \cite[p.~22]{LivingstonKnotTheory}.
    \begin{theorem}
        If $\gamma:\mathbb{S}^{1}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{3}$ is a
        (smooth or polygonal) knot, if $\mathbf{v}\in\mathbb{S}^{2}$, and if
        $\varepsilon>0$, then there is an equivalent knot
        $\gamma':\mathbb{S}^{1}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{3}$ such that:
        \begin{equation}
            \max\big(
                \{\,||\gamma(s)-\gamma'(t)||\;:\;\,s,t\in\mathbb{S}^{1}\,\}
            \big)<\varepsilon
        \end{equation}
        and such that the projection of $\gamma'$ along $\mathbf{v}$ is regular.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{figure}
        \centering
        \includegraphics{trefoil_knot_001.pdf}
        \caption{Trefoil Knot Diagram}
        \label{fig:trefoil_knot_001}
    \end{figure}
    A regular projection of a knot is not enough to completely identify the
    embedding, we need to keep track of crossing information. This is done by
    leaving gaps in the curve to indicate which strand is \textit{under} and
    which is \textit{over}, as in Fig.~\ref{fig:trefoil_knot_001}. A
    knot projection with the over and under crossings labeled is called a
    \textbf{knot diagram}.
    \par\hfill\par
    Alexander and Briggs \cite{AlexanderBriggs1926}, and independently
    Kurt Reidemeister \cite{Reidemeister1927}, proved in the 1920s that
    knot equivalence can be demonstrated using knot diagrams and finite
    sequences of \textbf{Reidemeister moves}, of which there are three types.
    \par\hfill\par

        \includegraphics{reidemeister_3_move.pdf}
        \caption{Reidemeister III}
        \label{fig:reidemeister_3_move}
    \end{figure}
    \textbf{Type I} (Fig.~\ref{fig:reidemeister_1_move}) allows us to undo
    \textit{loops}. That is, if we find a portion of a knot diagram in which
    a strand passes over itself, with no other strands of the knot being
    included, we may cancel out this crossing and reduce it to a straight
    line. This reduces the number of crossings in the diagram by one.
    \par\hfill\par
    \textbf{Type II} (Fig.~\ref{fig:reidemeister_2_move}) involves one strand
    passing over another twice. If we see see one strand go over another, and
    then again go over the same strand with no new crossings in between,
    we may \textit{pull} the bottom strand from underneath the upper one,
    reducing the number of crossings in the diagram by two.
    \par\hfill\par
    \textbf{Type III} (Fig.~\ref{fig:reidemeister_3_move}) is the most
    complicated, and has the unfortunate fact that it does not reduce the
    number of crossings in the diagram. If one strand passes entirely beneath
    two other strands that are making a crossing, we may pull the first
    strand below this crossing and on to the other side. In both diagrams we
    have three crossings drawn.
    \par\hfill\par
    In addition to these three types, we are also allowed to use their
    \textit{mirrors}. We may also reverse these three processes by introducing
    loops or placing one strand on top of another. This is not a redundant task.
    This will be made clearer after a definition.
    \begin{definition}[\textbf{Crossing Number of a Knot}]
        The crossing number of a knot is the minimum number of crossings
        possible for all equivalent diagrams of the knot.
    \end{definition}
    Repeated application of Type I and Type II may result in
    a knot diagram that has fewer crossings than the one you started with, but
    this may only be a \textit{local minimum}. To achieve the true crossing
    number you may first need to make the knot diagram \textit{more}
    complicated by introducing new crossings via the reverse of these two moves.
    Indeed, as we will discuss soon, you may need to make the knot diagram
    a \textit{lot} more complicated before you can make it simpler.
    \par\hfill\par
    As mentioned, the sufficiency of these three moves was proved in the 1920s
    by Alexander, Briggs, and Reidemeister. It is a relatively new fact that
    all three are \textit{necessary}
    \cite{OstlundReidemeisterMoves2001},
    \cite{HaggeReidemeisterRequired2005}. We can easily prove the necessity of
    Type I by introducing the \textbf{writhe} of a knot diagram, which
    will be needed later for the Jones polynomial. To do this requires a
    discussion of \textbf{oriented knots} and \textbf{crossing signs}.
    \par\hfill\par
    The circle $\mathbb{S}^{1}$ is an orientable manifold. You can orient it
    clockwise or counterclockwise with respect to the $x$ axis. That is,
    start at the $x$ axis and travel to the negative $y$ axis
    (clockwise), or travel to the positive $y$ axis (counterclockwise).
    We can copy our chosen orientation onto an embedding of
    $\mathbb{S}^{1}$ into $\mathbb{R}^{3}$, giving us an oriented knot.
    \begin{definition}[\textbf{Oriented Knot}]
        An oriented Knot is a knot
        $\gamma:\mathbb{S}^{1}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{3}$ equipped with an
        orientation, or a chosen direction.
    \end{definition}
    If we project an oriented knot onto a knot diagram, we can make note of the
    orientation by marking the diagram with arrows indicating the directions
    at several points. This will be useful for several constructions.
    \begin{definition}[\textbf{Oriented Knot Diagram}]
        An oriented knot diagram is a knot diagram of an oriented knot where
        the orientation of the knot is indicated by directed arrows.
    \end{definition}
    The trefoil is given an oriented knot diagram in
    Fig.~\ref{fig:trefoil_knot_oriented_001}. While slightly artificial (it is
    always possible to give a knot one of the two possible orientations), we
    will use oriented knot diagrams to describe things like Gauss codes,
    writhe, and the Jones polynomial, so the definition is not entirely
    useless. Indeed, orientations give rise to the notion of
    \textbf{invertible knots}, embeddings
    $\gamma:\mathbb{S}^{1}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{3}$ that are equivalent to
    $\tilde{\gamma}:\mathbb{S}^{1}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{3}$ with
    $\tilde{\gamma}\big((x,\,y)\big)=\gamma\big((x,\,-y)\big)$. That is,
    knots that are equivalent to the same knot but with the orientation
    reversed. The existence of \textit{non-invertible knots} was proven in
    1963 by Hale Trotter (1931-2022 C.E.) \cite{TrotterInvertibleKnots1963}.%
    \footnote{%
        Alexander and Briggs mention in \cite[p.~563-564]{AlexanderBriggs1926}
        that a knot need not be equivalent to its inverse, but do not provide
        any examples.
    }
    \par\hfill\par

        \includegraphics{trefoil_knot_oriented_001.pdf}
        \caption{Oriented Trefoil}
        \label{fig:trefoil_knot_oriented_001}
    \end{figure}
    Once an orientation is given, we may discuss the \textbf{sign} of a
    crossing. Given an oriented knot diagram $K$ and any crossing in our
    diagram, we rotate our heads until the \textit{forward} directions for
    both strand is point upwards in the plane
    (Fig.~\ref{fig:crossing_signs}). If left-to-right pass over
    right-to-left, we call the crossing \textit{positive}. Otherwise,
    if right-to-left passes over left-to-right, we call it crossing
    negative. The \textbf{sign of the crossing} is the value $-1$ or $+1$,
    depending on if the crossing is positive or negative. Being integer valued
    we may sum the signs of all crossings of a knot diagram.
    \begin{definition}[\textbf{Writhe of a Knot Diagram}]
        The writhe of an oriented knot diagram is the sum of the signs of all
        of the crossings in the diagram.
    \end{definition}
    It is worth noting that if one were to reverse the orientation, the
    crossings in Fig.~\ref{fig:crossing_signs} will flip. After turning our
    heads 180 degrees (carefully as to not fracture ones neck) we will
    find that the image does not change. Hence the writhe is independent of
    the orientation and is dependent only on the knot diagram itself. It is
    not an invariant of the knot. While unchanged by the second and third
    moves, Type I moves alter the writhe of the diagram by $+1$ or
    $-1$. By introducing loops we see that the writhe a knot diagram can be
    any integer for any knot type $K$. Since Type II and Type III do not alter
    writhe, we see that the Type I move is a necessary Reidemeister move.

    Before moving on, we generalize knots slightly and discuss \textbf{links}.
    \begin{definition}[\textbf{Link}]
        A link with $N\in\mathbb{N}$ components is a polygonal embedding of
        $\sqcup_{n=0}^{N}\mathbb{S}^{1}$ into $\mathbb{R}^{3}$.
        That is, $N$ distinct knots
        $\gamma_{n}:\mathbb{S}^{1}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{3}$ such that for all
        $m\ne{n}$ we have
        $\gamma_{m}[\mathbb{S}^{1}]\cap\gamma_{n}[\mathbb{S}^{1}]=\emptyset$.
    \end{definition}
    \begin{figure}

        \caption{Hopf Link}
        \label{fig:hopf_link_diagram}
    \end{figure}
    We consider $0\in\mathbb{N}$ to be valid and allow zero component links.
    This can be useful for computational purpose, for example in the discussion
    of the Kauffman bracket. $N=1$ is also allowed, in which case we have a
    knot. The simplest non-trivial link is the \textit{Hopf link} which consists
    of two components linked together with two crossings
    (Fig.~\ref{fig:hopf_link_diagram}). This link can be found in
    Jewish\footnote{%
        The Josefov Jewish Council building in Prague contains the
        Hopf link in the form of the star of David \cite{KatlasHopfLink},
        similar to Fig.~\ref{fig:hopf_link_star_of_david}.

    and Japanese\footnote{%
        The \textit{Chigai Kuginuki}, the emblem, or \textit{mon},
        of the As\~{o} family depicts a Hopf link \cite{KatlasHopfLink}
        similar to the one shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:hopf_link_chigai_kuginuki}.
    }
    cultures, and almost certainly others. Another celebrated example is
    the Whitehead link\footnote{%
        Named after J. H. C. Whitehead who used the link in his
        construction of the Whitehead
        manifold, a contractible 3-manifold without boundary that is not
        homeomorphic to Euclidean 3-space \cite{WhiteheadManifold}.
        Whitehead had hoped the non-existence of such an object could be
        used to prove the Poincar\'{e} conjecture
        \cite{WhiteheadPoincareConjecture}.

    Many notions for knots may be mimicked for links. In particular we may
    consider \textit{link equivalence}, \textit{link types},
    \textit{regular link projections}, and \textit{link diagrams}, and we
    may perform all of this in the smooth setting where the embeddings are
    done smoothly. We may also orient our links and define the
    writhe of an oriented link
    diagram. One must be careful in the computation of writhe. Unlike the
    one-component knot setting, where the writhe is independent of the
    orientation, for link diagrams the writhe is indeed orientation dependent.
    In general, given an $N\in\mathbb{N}$ component link, there are
    $2^{N}$ possible ways to orient it. If we order the components and denote
    $0$ for a clockwise orientation and $1$ for a counterclockwise one, we
    obtain a string on $N$ characters where the $k^{\small\textrm{th}}$ entry
    corresponds to the orientation of the $k^{\small\textrm{th}}$ component.
    The writhe associated to this combination of orientations will be the same
    as the writhe of \textit{complement} of this string, the string
    obtained by swapping all zeros with ones and vice-versa,
    by an argument identical to the
    one-component knot case. So there are at most $2^{N-1}$ possible writhes
    for a link, and this is sharp. The Hopf link in
    Fig.~\ref{fig:hopf_link_diagram} can take on writhes of $+2$ and $-2$,
    pending the orientation given. This will cause a slight inconvenience in
    our definition of the Jones polynomial.
