\section{Basic Definitions and Invariants}
    Following \cite[p.~15]{LivingstonKnotTheory}, we define a knot as follows.
    \begin{definition}[\textbf{Knot}]
        A knot is a polygonal (piece-wise linear) embedding
        $\gamma:\mathbb{S}^{1}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{3}$ of the circle into
        three dimensional Euclidean space.
    \end{definition}
    While it is possible to define knots using \textit{continuous} embeddings,
    such a definition provides for the existence of
    \textit{wild knots} \cite{FoxArtinWildKnots1948}.\footnote{%
        See \cite{BrowneWildKnots} for how to procedurally generate wild knots.
    }
    \textit{Smooth} embeddings can similarly be used, albeit at the expense of
    a slightly harder definition of \textit{knot equivalence}. In the
    polygonal case this comes with ease. Given a piece-wise linear embedding
    $\gamma:\mathbb{S}^{1}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{3}$ with vertices
    $P_{1},\,\dots,\,P_{n}$ we are allowed to deform $\gamma$ into a new one
    $\gamma'$ formed by the (ordered) vertices $P_{1},\,\dots,\,P_{n},\,P'$
    such that the triangle $\Delta{P}_{n}P'P_{1}$ only intersects $\gamma$
    along the line segment $\overline{P_{1}P_{n}}$. This is called an
    \textit{elementary knot equivalence}. With this we define equivalent knots.
    \begin{definition}[\textbf{Equivalent Knots}]
        Equivalent knots are polygonal embeddings
        $\gamma,\gamma':\mathbb{S}^{1}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{3}$ and
        that differ by
        a finite number of elementary knot equivalences.
    \end{definition}
