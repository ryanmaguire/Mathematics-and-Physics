I am indebted to my advisors Vladimir Chernov and Peter Doyle who have
helped me grow in knot theory and topology over the past few years. They will
forever have my thanks. Additional thanks to the committee members, Ina Petkova
and Patricia Cahn, for their help in defending this thesis. Their comments
were incredibly valuable in shaping this document.

I also must thank James "Kiwi" Graham-Eagle at UML,
for without him I would have never made it this far in mathematics. Further
thanks to Richard French at Wellesley college for his support over the past
seven years. The many students in the mathematics departments at UML and
Dartmouth College who endured my pestering must also be acknowledged, but in
particular Sam Gomez and Ben Adenbaum for bearing most of it. Lastly I must
thank the Seeley family for providing me with a home for the better half of a
decade, and to Molly McQuillin for being with me for over a decade. I thank you
all.
