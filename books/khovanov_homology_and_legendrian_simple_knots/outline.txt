New Work:
Chapter 1:
     Modified Tait graph for virtual knots.
Chapter 2:
     Gauss code algorithm for the Jones polynomial.
     New implementation of the symbolic calculus.
     Newton Basin's for Jones polynomials (not explored much here).
     Modified Tate graph algorithm for the Jones polynomial.
     Computing the Jones polynomial explicitly for twist knots using Tait graphs.
         This computation has been done, but not using the recursive formula from the Tait graph.
Chapter 4:
     All tables and both main theorems.
         Khovanov distinguishes torus and twist knots up to 19 crossings.
         Khovanov distinguishes the conjectured Legendrian simple knots.
     Statistics and tabulations.
         Relative strengths of Jones, Khovanov, and HOMFLY-PT are new.
         Tables are available at knots.dartmouth.edu.
