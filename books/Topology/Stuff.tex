    \title{A CW Complex That is Not First Countable}
    \author{Ryan Maguire}

    \maketitle
    Let $X^{0}=\vector{0}$ consist of a single point and
    $X^{1}=\coprod_{n\in\mathbb{N}}I$. That is, the disjoint union of countably
    many intervals. An element is denoted $(n,x)$ with $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and
    $x\in{I}$. The attaching maps send $(n,0)$ and $(n,1)$ to $\vector{0}$
    for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$, so we obtain countably many circles which are
    connected at a single point. The CW Complex topology is then just the
    normal quotient topology since this is 1 dimensional. The resulting space is
    not first countable since $[\vector{0}]$ does not have a countable
    neighborhood basis. For suppose it does and let $\mathcal{B}$ be such a
    basis. Since $\mathcal{B}$ is hypothesized to be countable, there is a
    surjection $\mathcal{U}:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathcal{B}$. Since
    $\mathcal{U}_{n}\in\mathcal{B}$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$, $\mathcal{U}_{n}$
    is open. But a set is open if and only if $\pi^{\minus{1}}[\mathcal{U}_{n}]$
    is open where $\pi$ is the canonical projection map. Since
    $[\vector{0}]\in\mathcal{U}_{n}$, $[(n,0)],[(n,1)]\in\mathcal{U}_{n}$ since
    $[\vector{0}]=[(n,0)]=[(n,1)]$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$. But then $(n,0)$
    and $(n,1)$ are elements of $\pi^{\minus{1}}[\mathcal{U}_{n}]$. Since
    $\pi^{\minus{1}}[\mathcal{U}_{n}]$ is open there exists $a_{n}>0$ and
    $b_{n}>0$ such that
    $\{n\}\times[0,a_{n})\subseteq\pi^{\minus{1}}[\mathcal{U}_{n}]$ and
    $\{n\}\times(b_{n},1]\subseteq\pi^{\minus{1}}[\mathcal{U}_{n}]$. Let
    $r_{n}=\min\{a_{n},b_{n},\frac{1}{2}\}/2$ and define:
    \begin{equation}
        \mathcal{O}=\{\vector{0}\}\cup\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\Big(
            \big(\{n\}\times[0,r_{n})\big)\cup\big(\{n\}\times(r_{n},1]\big)
        \Big)
    \end{equation}
    Then $\mathcal{O}$ is open in the disjoint topology and is saturated since
    $\pi^{\minus{1}}\big[\pi[\mathcal{O}]\big]=\mathcal{O}$. Therefore
    $[\mathcal{O}]=\pi[\mathcal{O}]$ is open and contains $[\vector{0}]$. But if
    $[\mathcal{O}]$ contains $[\vector{0}]$, then since $\mathcal{B}$ is a
    neighborhood basis of $[\vector{0}]$ there is a $\mathcal{V}\in\mathcal{B}$
    such that $\mathcal{V}\subseteq[\mathcal{O}]$. But $\mathcal{U}$ is
    surjective so there is an $N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that
    $\mathcal{U}_{N}=\mathcal{V}$. But
    $\pi[\{N\}\times(r_{N},a_{N})]\subseteq\mathcal{U}_{N}$ and
    $\pi[\{N\}\times(r_{N},a_{N})]\nsubseteq[\mathcal{O}]$, a contradiction
    since $\mathcal{U}\subseteq[\mathcal{O}]$. Hence, $\mathcal{B}$ is not a
    neighborhood basis.

    Some comments. We've used countable choice for the $r_{n}$. A sequential
    space is a topological space where sequences suffices to define openness.
    $\mathcal{U}\subseteq{X}$ is open if and only if for every sequence
    converging to a point in $\mathcal{U}$, the sequence is \textit{eventually}
    contained in $\mathcal{U}$. That is, open and sequentially open are
    identical. Open always implies sequentially open, the
    converse may fail (cocountable topology on $\mathbb{R}$). In a sequential
    space continuity and sequential continuity are identical. A very mild
    condition that a space be sequential
    is first countability. It is not necessary, just sufficient. A necessary and
    sufficient condition is the following:
    \begin{theorem}
        A topological space $\topspace{X}$ is sequential if and only if it is
        the quotient of a metric space.
    \end{theorem}
    Since the disjoint union of metric spaces is still a metric space (assuming
    axiom of choice), and since CW complex are obtained from quotients of
    these, CW complexes are indeed sequential. Hence, sequences suffice to prove
    continuity.
