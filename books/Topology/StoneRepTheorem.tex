    \section{Motivation}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Set theory, algebra of sets, $\sigma$ algebras, $(\mathcal{P}(A),\cap,\cup)$.
            \item Boole's axioms, redundancy of absorption and associativity.
            \item Idempotant $a*a=a$, bounded $(a*e_{\circ}=e_{\circ})$, absorption.
            \item Several theorems later comes associativity.
            \item Not a field, no inverses exists other than for identities.
        \end{itemize}
    \section{Topology}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Topologies, Hausdorff, compact, connected, totally disconnected, clopen.
            \item Stone spaces.
            \item Bases.
            \item Topology generated by a subset.
        \end{itemize}
    \section{Lattices}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Partial orderings, lattices (comm, assoc, abs, idem), bounded lattice, Boolean lattice.
            \item Filters and ultra filters.
            \item Stone space generated by ultra filters on a Boolean lattice.
            \item Stone's representation theorem.
        \end{itemize}
        A partially ordered set is a set $A$ with a relation $\leq$ that is reflexive,
        antisymmetric, and transitive. A filter is a subset $F$ of a partial ordered set $P$ such that
        for all $x,y\in{F}$ there is a $z\in{F}$ such that $z\leq{x}$ and $z\leq{y}$. That is, all
        $x,y\in{F}$ have a common lower bound. Moreover, if $x\in{F}$ and $y\in{P}$ are such that
        $x\leq{y}$, then $y\in{F}$. An ultra-filter is a maximal filter. That is, a filter that is
        not properly contained in any other proper filter. The Stone space is the set of all
        ultrafilters of the Boolean algebra under the partial ordering $a\leq{b}$ iff $a*b=b$.
        The topology is generated from the collection of all ultrafilters that contain a particular
        point, and then union over all points.
