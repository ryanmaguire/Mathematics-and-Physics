        \section{Review}
            This section is meant to review some concepts from point-set
            topology. In particular, basic definitions, quotient spaces, and
            products. An excellent source for a more in-depth reading is
            \cite{Munkres2000}.
            \subsection{Topological Spaces}
                We start with the definition of topological spaces. We wish to
                generalize the notion of \textit{openness} that occurs in metric
                spaces\index{Metric Space}, or more concretely in the study of
                $\nspace$. To do this we axiomatize the properties of open sets:
                Taking arbitrary unions of open sets results in an open set, and
                the finite intersection of open sets is still open. Furthermore,
                we define the entire space and the empty set $\emptyset$ to be
                open. This gives us our definition of a topological space.
                \begin{fdefinition}{Topological Space}{Topological_Space}
                    A topological space is a set $X$ with a topology
                    $\tau\subseteq\powset{X}$, which is a collection of subsets
                    of $X$ called the \textit{open} subsets, such that:
                    \index{Topological Space}\index{Open Subset}
                    \begin{enumerate}
                        \item \label{def:top:Empty_and_X_Open}%
                              $\emptyset\in\tau$ and $X\in\tau$
                        \item \label{def:top:Finite_Intersections}%
                              For all $\mathcal{U},\mathcal{V}\in\tau$ it is
                              true that $\mathcal{U}\cap\mathcal{V}\in\tau$
                        \item \label{def:top:Arbitrary_Unions}%
                              For any subset $\mathcal{O}\subseteq\tau$ it is
                              true that $\bigcup\mathcal{O}\in\tau$
                    \end{enumerate}
                \end{fdefinition}
                \begin{example}
                    The standard metric topology on $\nspace[]$ is induced by
                    declaring $\mathcal{U}\subseteq\nspace[]$ to be open if and
                    only if for all $x\in\mathcal{U}$ there is an
                    $\varepsilon>0$ such that
                    $(x-\varepsilon,x+\varepsilon)\subseteq\mathcal{U}$. So an
                    open interval of the form $(a,b)$ is open
                    (see Fig.~\ref{fig:Open_Subset_of_R}).%
                    \index{Topology!on $\mathbb{R}$}
                \end{example}
                \begin{figure}[H]
                    \centering
                    \captionsetup{type=figure}
                    \input{tikz/Open_Interval_is_Open_Subset_of_R.tex}
                    \caption{An Open Subset of $\nspace[]$}
                    \label{fig:Open_Subset_of_R}
                \end{figure}
                By examining Fig.~\ref{fig:Open_Interval_Intersect_is_Open} we
                can convince ourselves that the intersection of open intervals
                is again open so long as we declare the empty set to be open.
                That is, $(0,1)$ and $(2,3)$ are open sets, but
                $(0,1)\cap(2,3)=\emptyset$. This highlights the need in
                requiring the empty set to be an element of the topology.

                \end{figure}
                \begin{example}
                    The topology induced on a metric space $\metspace{X}$ is
                    defined by making $\mathcal{U}\subseteq{X}$ open if and only
                    if for all $x\in\mathcal{U}$ there is an $\varepsilon>0$
                    such that the $\varepsilon$ ball centered about $x$ is
                    contained in $\mathcal{U}$:
                    $\rball{\varepsilon}{\metspace{X}}{x}\subseteq\mathcal{U}$
                    (see Fig.~\ref{fig:Open_Subset_Metric_Space}).%
                    \index{Topology!on a Metric Space}
                \end{example}
                \begin{figure}[H]

                \end{figure}
                The metric topology on $\nspace[]$ is often called the
                \textit{standard} topology, but it is not the only one we can
                place on it.
                \begin{example}
                    \index{Topology!Chaotic/Indiscrete/Trivial}%
                    The chaotic topology, also called the trivial topology or
                    the indiscrete topology, is the simplest topology one can
                    define on a set. We write:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \tau=\{\,\emptyset,\,X\,\}
                    \end{equation}
                    This trivially satisfies the three properties enumerated in
                    Def.~\ref{def:Topological_Space}.
                \end{example}
                \begin{example}
                    \index{Topology!Discrete}%
                    The largest topology one can define is the entire power set:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \tau=\powset{X}
                    \end{equation}
                    Again, rather trivially, this is a topology on $X$. For
                    those who have studied metric spaces, it is called the
                    trivial topology since it is the topology induced by the
                    discrete metric:\index{Metric!Discrete}%
                    \begin{equation}
                        d(x,y)=
                        \begin{cases}
                            0,&x=y\\
                            1,&x\ne{y}
                        \end{cases}
                    \end{equation}
                \end{example}
                The closed interval $[a,b]$ is \textit{not} open in the standard
                topology (see Fig.~\ref{fig:Closed_Interval_Not_Open}), but it
                \textit{is} open with the discrete topology since everything is
                open in that topology. Because of this there is possible
                ambiguity with saying $\mathcal{U}$ is open if one has not
                specified the topology. Thankfully with most spaces one is
                interested in there is a standard or natural topology, and we
                usually choose this one without saying so. For metric spaces we
                almost always choose the metric topology.
                \begin{figure}[H]

                    \label{fig:Closed_Interval_Not_Open}
                \end{figure}
                With the real line the intersection of finitely many open sets
                is still open, whereas we've only required the intersection of
                two open sets to still be open. We extend this to any finite
                collection by induction.
                \begin{theorem}
                    \label{thm:Finite_Intersections_Is_Open}%
                    If $\topspace{X}$ is a topological space and if
                    $\mathcal{O}\subseteq\tau$ is a finite collection of open
                    sets, then $\bigcap\mathcal{O}\in\tau$.
                \end{theorem}
                \begin{proof}
                    Apply induction to Def.~\ref{def:Topological_Space}
                    part \ref{def:top:Finite_Intersections}.
                \end{proof}
                Now that we've presented some examples, we define what it means
                for a set to be closed\index{Closed Subset}. In analysis we
                defined a closed set to be a set that has all of its limit
                points. For topology this is not general enough (topological
                spaces where sequences suffice to define closedness are called
                \textit{sequential spaces}\index{Sequential Space}). There is a
                standard theorem one comes across that a subset of $\nspace[]$
                is closed if and only if its complement is open. We take this
                theorem and adopt it as the definition of what it means to be a
                closed set in a general topological space.
                \begin{fdefinition}{Closed Subset}{Closed_Subset}
                    A closed subset of a topological space $\topspace{X}$ is a
                    subset $\mathcal{C}\subseteq{X}$ such that there exists an
                    open set $\mathcal{U}\in\tau$ with
                    $\mathcal{C}=X\setminus\mathcal{U}$.%
                    \index{Closed Subset}
                \end{fdefinition}
                That is, closed sets are the complements of open sets. There is
                a common misconception that closed sets are simply \textit{not}
                open sets, and vice-versa, but this is not so. In the discrete
                topology every set is open, and hence every set is closed. In
                the indiscrete topology there are no non-empty proper open
                subsets, and hence most sets are neither open nor closed. These
                examples show that openness and closedness are
                \textit{a priori} unrelated notions. If we know $A\subseteq{X}$
                is open and nothing more, we cannot conclude whether or not $A$
                is closed, and similarly if we know $B\subseteq{X}$ is closed
                and nothing more, then we cannot conclude whether or not $B$ is
                open.
                \begin{example}
                    The cocountable topology on $\mathbb{R}$ is the standard
                    example of a space where sequences are insufficient to
                    describe closedness. A subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is declared
                    open if it's complement is a coutable set. In this topology
                    \textit{every} subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has it's limit points
                    and hence every set is \textit{sequentially} closed, but
                    this is \textit{not} the discrete topology. That is, not
                    every set is \textit{topologically} closed, i.e. the
                    complement of an open subset.
                \end{example}
                Using the idempotent laws of complement, we obtain the
                following:
                \begin{theorem}
                    \label{thm:Closed_Iff_Comp_is_Open}%
                    If $\topspace{X}$ is a topological space and
                    $C\subseteq{X}$, then $C$ is closed if and only if
                    $X\setminus{C}$ is open.
                \end{theorem}
                \begin{proof}
                    For if $X\setminus{C}$ is open, then
                    $X\setminus(X\setminus{C})$ is closed
                    (Def.~\ref{def:Closed_Subset}). From the idempotent law of
                    complements, $X\setminus(X\setminus{C})=C$ and hence $C$ is
                    closed. By a similar argument if $C$ is closed, then
                    $X\setminus{C}$ is open.
                \end{proof}
                Using De Morgan's laws we can define an equivalent notion of
                topological spaces using closed sets. De Morgan's laws state for
                sets $A,B,X$, with $A,B\subseteq{X}$, the following is true:%
                \index{De Morgan's Laws}
                \begin{subequations}
                    \begin{align}
                        X\setminus(A\cap{B})
                            &=(X\setminus{A})\cup(X\setminus{B})\\
                        X\setminus(A\cup{B})
                            &=(X\setminus{A})\cap(X\setminus{B})
                    \end{align}
                \end{subequations}
                We can write this more suggestively if we let
                $X\setminus{A}=A^{C}$ ($C$ for complement).
                \vspace{-5ex}
                \twocolumneq{(A\cap{B})^{C}=A^{C}\cup{B}^{C}}
                            {(A\cup{B})^{C}=A^{C}\cap{B}^{C}}
                De Morgan's laws hold for arbitrary unions and intersections:
                \twocolumneq{%
                    \Big(\bigcap\mathcal{U}\Big)^{C}=\bigcup\mathcal{U}^{C}%
                }{%
                    \Big(\bigcup\mathcal{U}\Big)^{C}=\bigcap\mathcal{U}^{C}%
                }
                With this we may prove the following.
                \begin{theorem}
                    If $\topspace{X}$ is a topological space, then $\emptyset$
                    and $X$ are closed, if $\mathcal{C},\mathcal{D}\subseteq{X}$
                    are closed, then $\mathcal{C}\cup\mathcal{D}$ is closed, and
                    if $\Lambda\subseteq\powset{X}$ is a collection of closed
                    subsets of $X$, then $\bigcap\Lambda$ is closed.
                \end{theorem}
                \begin{proof}
                    For the first part, apply the definition of closed subsets
                    (Def.~\ref{def:Closed_Subset}) to
                    Def.~\ref{def:Topological_Space} part
                    \ref{def:top:Empty_and_X_Open} and recall that
                    $X\setminus\emptyset=X$ and $X\setminus{X}=\emptyset$. For
                    the latter parts, combine De Morgan's Laws with
                    Def.~\ref{def:Topological_Space} parts
                    \ref{def:top:Finite_Intersections} and
                    \ref{def:top:Arbitrary_Unions}, respectively.
                \end{proof}
                We may expand the union of two closed sets to the unions of
                finitely many closed sets inductively as we did in
                Thm.~\ref{thm:Finite_Intersections_Is_Open}.
            \subsection{Continuity}
                In an analysis course one talks about continuous functions by
                one of two equivalent means: The $\varepsilon-\delta$ definition
                and by the limit of sequences.

                    The $\epsilon-\delta$ definition states that if we move at
                    most $\delta$ in the $x$ direction, then we will have no
                    more than $\varepsilon$ amount of error in the $y$
                    direction (see Fig.~\ref{fig:Eps_Delta_Def_Cont}), the
                    sequence definition saying that as we get arbitrarily close
                    to $x_{0}$ by any sequence
                    $a:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\nspace[]$, then $f(a_{n})$
                    approaches $f(x_{0})$
                    (see Fig.~\ref{fig:Sequence_Def_Continuity}). Both of these
                    definitions require a metric which a general topological
                    space may not have. While one can talk about convergence of
                    sequences in a topological space, this is insufficient to
                    fully descibe continuity for many spaces.

                    We seek a definition that is general enough to apply to any
                    topological space and which agrees with continuity in the
                    familiar setting of a metric space. This is obtain by
                    considering the following fundamental characterization of
                    continuous real-valued functions. A function
                    $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is continuous
                    \textit{if and only if} for every open subset
                    $\mathcal{U}\subseteq\mathbb{R}$ it is true that the
                    \textit{pre-image} of $\mathcal{U}$ under $f$ is open. That
                    is, $f^{\minus{1}}[\mathcal{U}]\subseteq\mathbb{R}$ is open.
                    This can be worded concisely by the phrase
                    \textit{the pre-image of open is open}.

                Since this is an if and only if we may adopt it as our
                definition of continuity, and this only uses the notion of an
                open set which topological spaces do have.
                \begin{fdefinition}{Continuous Function}{Continuous_Function}
                    A continuous function from a topological space
                    $\topspace[X]{X}$ to a topological space $\topspace[Y]{Y}$
                    is a function $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ such that for every open
                    subset $\mathcal{V}\in\tau_{Y}$ it is true that
                    $f^{\minus{1}}[\mathcal{V}]\in\tau_{X}$. The pre-image of
                    open is open.\index{Continuous Function}
                \end{fdefinition}
                \begin{example}
                    If $\topspace{X}$ is any topological space, if
                    $Y$ is a set, and if we choose the chaotic topology
                    $\{\emptyset,Y\}$ on $Y$, then any function
                    $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ is automatically continuous. There are
                    only two open subsets to check and:
                    \twocolumneq{f^{\minus{1}}[\emptyset]=\emptyset}
                                {f^{\minus{1}}[Y]=X}
                    Both of which are open subsets, and hence $f$ is continuous.
                    This is one justification for calling this the chaotic
                    topology: Every function is continuous. There are other
                    reasons, every sequence converges to every point
                    simultaneously, no points can be separated, and so on.
                \end{example}
                \begin{example}
                    If $\topspace{Y}$ is a topological space, if $X$ is a set,
                    and if we choose the discrete topology $\powset{X}$ on $X$,
                    then any function $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ is continuous. Given
                    any open subset $\mathcal{V}\in\tau$, the pre-image
                    $f^{\minus{1}}[\mathcal{V}]$ is a subset of $X$ by
                    definition and hence is an element of $\powset{X}$. That is,
                    $f$ is continuous.
                \end{example}
                An important concept in topology is that of a
                \textit{homeomorphism}. A homeomorphism is a continuous function
                $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ that is bijective and such that the inverse
                function $f^{\minus{1}}:Y\rightarrow{X}$ is also continuous.
                If there exists a homeomorphism between topological spaces
                $\topspace[X]{X}$ and $\topspace[Y]{Y}$, then we call them
                \textit{homeomorphic}. Topologically, homeomorphic spaces are
                indistinguishable.\index{Homeomorphism}
                \begin{example}
                    The open interval $(\minus\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2})$ is
                    homeomorphic to the entire real line via the tangent
                    function $\tan:(\minus\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2})%
                    \rightarrow\nspace[]$. This is continuous, bijective, and
                    has a continuous inverse $\arctan$. This example shows that
                    boundedness is a metric property and not a topological one.
                \end{example}
                One question that often arises is when can we conclude two
                spaces are homeomorphic. Many simple conditions that hold in
                $\nspace[]$ do not generalize. For example, any continuous
                bijection $f:\nspace[]\rightarrow\nspace[]$ is automatically a
                homeomorphism since the inverse will be continuous. This is a
                consequence of the intermediate value theorem which implies any
                such function is then strictly monotonic. This does not
                generalize to arbitrary topological spaces, it doesn't even
                generalize to subspaces of $\nspace$. We can continuously and
                bijectively map $[0,1)$ to the unit circle $\nsphere[1]$ by
                $f(x)=\big(\cos(2\pi{x}),\sin(2\pi{x})\big)$, but the inverse is
                not continuous. Rigorously it can't be since $\nsphere[1]$ is
                \textit{compact} but $[0,1)$ is not, and homeomorphisms preserve
                such a notion. Intuitively, we have tied up the ends of $[0,1)$
                continuously, but going from the unit circle to $[0,1)$ involves
                ripping the circle somewhere, which is not a continuous
                operation.
                \par\hfill\par
                Another false proposition is that if $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ and
                $g:Y\rightarrow{X}$ are continuous bijections, then the two
                spaces are homeomorphic. This is false. Consider the following
                subspaces of $\nspace[2]$ shown in
                Fig.~\ref{fig:Non_Homeomorphic_Subspace}.
                \begin{figure}[H]
                    \centering
                    \captionsetup{type=figure}
                    \includegraphics{images/Non_Homeo_with_Cont_Bij}
                    \caption{Non-Homeomorphic Subspaces of $\nspace[2]$}
                    \label{fig:Non_Homeomorphic_Subspace}
                \end{figure}
                First, let's describe these spaces. Both spaces consist of the
                $x$ axis in the plane $\nspace[2]$. We then glue the half-open
                interval $[0,1)$ upwards in the $y$ direction starting at
                $(0,0)$ and then continuing doing this to the \textit{left}
                forever. Next, we glue circles starting at $(3,0)$ and continue
                to the \textit{right} forever. The only difference is in the
                middle. For the top space we attach a circle at $(1,0)$ and a
                half-open interval at $(2,0)$. For the bottom we simply attach
                two circles.
                \par\hfill\par
                These are \textit{not} homeomorphic. To see this we need to know
                that a homeomorphism $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ induces a
                homeomorphism between any subspace $A\subseteq{X}$ and its image
                $f[A]\subseteq{Y}$. Thus we need to find a subspace of the first
                image that does not exist in the second, or vice versa. If we
                remove the bottom point from the interval wedged between two
                circles, then we are left with three parts: an open interval,
                a string of infinitely many circles, and a string of infinitely
                many intervals plus one circle. No matter which point we remove
                from the second image the resulting subspace will not look like
                this, and hence these two spaces are not homeomorphic. However,
                there are continuous bijections $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ and
                $g:Y\rightarrow{X}$. For this we will avoid formulas, and rather
                describe the function pictorially. For $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ we
                take the interval wedged between the two circles and tie it up.
                This is identical to the function from $[0,1)$ to $\nsphere[1]$
                which was both continuous and bijective. The result of this
                procedure is continuous, bijective, and gives us the second
                image. For $g:Y\rightarrow{X}$, we look at the interval two bits
                away from the neareast circle and tie this up. We then translate
                everything to the right by two, yielding the first space.
                \par\hfill\par
                Now one might ask if we needed an infinitely large space, or at
                the very least a \textit{non-compact} one, and the answer is
                yes. If $X$ is compact, and if $Y$ is \textit{Hausdorff}, then
                any continuous bijection $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ is automatically a
                homeomorphism. To find counterexamples to the general claim we
                must then avoid such spaces.
            \subsection{More Notions to Review}
                It is hoped that the material previously discussed is all
                review. There are other notions needed that one should quickly
                read through if they have not seen them before, namely the
                notion of \textit{product spaces} and \textit{quotient spaces}.
                For product spaces we'll need to following theorem.
                \begin{ltheorem}{The Intersections of Topologies is a Topology}
                                {Intersection_of_Topologies_is_Topology}
                    If $X$ is a set and $T\subseteq\powset{\powset{X}}$ is a
                    non-empty collection of sets such that for all $\tau\in{T}$
                    it is true that $\tau$ is a topology on $X$, then
                    $\bigcap{T}$ is a topology on $X$.
                \end{ltheorem}
                \begin{proof}
                    Since every element of $T$ is a topology, $\emptyset$ and
                    $X$ are contained in all $\tau\in{T}$ and hence
                    $\emptyset,X\in\bigcap{T}$. If we have a collection
                    $\mathcal{O}$ of elements of $\bigcap{T}$, then each element
                    is in every topology $\tau\in{T}$ by the definition of
                    intersection. But then since all $\tau\in{T}$ are topologies
                    we know that $\bigcup\mathcal{O}\in\tau$. Since this is true
                    of all $\tau$ we conclude $\bigcup\mathcal{O}\in\bigcap{T}$.
                    By a similar argument, $\bigcap{T}$ is closed to finite
                    intersections. Hence, $\bigcap{T}$ is a topology on $X$.
                \end{proof}

                We use this to define the product topology on the Cartesian
                product of two topological spaces. Given $\topspace[X]{X}$ and
                $\topspace[Y]{Y}$ we would like to place a topology on
                $X\times{Y}$, moreover we would like this topology to agree with
                product spaces we already know, such as the standard topologies
                on $\nspace$ or the topologies induced by the product of metric
                spaces. Life would be simple if we could let
                $\tau=\tau_{X}\times\tau_{Y}$, but this may not have the union
                property of topologies. Indeed, if $X=\nspace[]$ and
                $Y=\nspace[]$, then $\tau_{X}\times\tau_{Y}$ is the set of all
                $\mathcal{U}\times\mathcal{V}$ where $\mathcal{U}$ and
                $\mathcal{V}$ are open. Since open subsets of $\nspace[]$ can be
                written as the countable union of open intervals, we can suppose
                $\mathcal{U}=(a,b)$ and $\mathcal{V}=(c,d)$ with
                $a,b,c,d\in\nspace[]$. The product
                $\mathcal{U}\times\mathcal{V}$ is an \textit{open rectangle}
                (see Fig.~\subref{fig:Open_Rectangle_in_R2}). A blob like the
                one in Fig.~\subref{fig:Open_Subset_Not_Product} is considered
                open in $\nspace[2]$ but cannot be written in the form
                $\mathcal{U}\times\mathcal{V}$.

                    Since the power set $\powset{X\times{Y}}$ is a topology on
                    $X\times{Y}$, the set of all topologies containing
                    $\tau_{X}\times\tau_{Y}$ is non-empty. We define the product
                    topology to be the \textit{smallest} topology containing
                    $\tau_{X}\times\tau_{Y}$. To make this precise we define

                    is the set of all topologies containing
                    $\tau_{X}\times\tau_{Y}$. By

                    $\tau_{X}\times\tau_{Y}$ and then add their unions and
                    intersections until we have a valid topology. Hence
                    $\nball[2]\subseteq\nspace[2]$ is open since we can tile it
                    with open rectangles

                \begin{example}
                    The torus can be viewed as the Cartesian product of two
                    circles equipped with the product topology
                    (see Fig.~\ref{fig:Torus_as_Prod_Space}).
                \end{example}
                \begin{figure}[H]

                    \label{fig:Torus_as_Prod_Space}
                \end{figure}
                Another way of viewing the torus involves quotient spaces. We
                take a square piece of paper and then roll it up into a
                cylinder. From here we stretch the bounding circles around and
                glue them together. This process is shown in
                Fig.~\ref{fig:Square_to_Torus}. The result is a donut shaped
                object that is homeomorphic to $\nsphere[1]\times\nsphere[1]$.
                This is made rigorous by the quotient topology induced by an
                equivalence relation $R$ on a topological space
                $\topspace{X}$\index{Topology!Quotient}. We look at the quotient
                set $X/R$ and topologize this by choosing the \textit{largest}
                topology that makes the projection map $q:X\rightarrow{X}/R$
                continuous. There's always such a topology since the chaotic
                topology $\{\emptyset,X/R\}$ does the trick, but this is too
                small and often boring. The quotient topology is defined by:%
                \index{Topology!Quotient Topology}\index{Quotient Topology}
                \begin{equation}
                    \tau_{X/R}=\{\,\mathcal{V}\subseteq{X}/R\;|\;
                        q^{\minus{1}}[\mathcal{V}]\in\tau\,\}
                \end{equation}
                The technical details are perhaps not too important for now, one
                should simply think of gluing together the parts identified by
                the equivalence relation $R$. Returning to the torus
                $\ntorus[]$, we may define it as the quotient space obtained by
                identifying parts of the closed unit square together.
                Explicitly, we identify $(x,0)$ with $(x,1)$ for all $x\in[0,1]$
                and similarly $(0,y)$ with $(1,y)$ for $y\in[0,1]$.

        \section{Homotopy Equivalence}
            With the basics of point-set topology now reviewed, we move onto to
            algebraic topology. Historically one of the first objects studied in
            this field was the \textit{fundamental group}%
            \index{Fundamental Group}, a concept related to \textit{homotopy}.
            To motivate this we first give an informal discussion on deformation
            retractions which is a very geometric and visual concept. We then
            rigorously define homotopy and retracts, which will make it easier
            to give a formal definition of deformation retractions.
            \subsection{Deformation Retraction}
                A deformation retraction\index{Deformation Retraction} from a
                topological space $\topspace{X}$ onto a subset $A\subseteq{X}$
                is a family of continuous functions $f_{t}:X\rightarrow{X}$
                indexed by the closed unit interval $I=[0,1]$ where
                $f_{0}=\identity{X}$, $f_{1}[X]=A$, and such that
                $f_{t}|_{A}=\identity{A}$ for all $t\in{I}$. Moreover, the
                function $H:X\times{I}\rightarrow{X}$ defined by
                $H(x,t)=f_{t}(x)$ should be continuous with respect to the
                product topology, the closed unit interval $I$ inheriting it's
                topology from $\nspace[]$.
                \begin{example}
                    We can take an annulus or a punctured plane, either will
                    do, and construct a deformation retract from this onto the
                    unit circle $\nsphere[1]$. We do this by noting the function
                    $h$ defined on $\nspace[2]\setminus\{(0,0)\}$ by:
                    \begin{equation}
                        h(\vector{x})=\frac{\vector{x}}{\norm{\vector{x}}_{2}}
                    \end{equation}
                    where $\norm{\vector{x}}_{2}$ is the \textit{Euclidean Norm}%
                    \index{Euclidean Norm} of the point $\vector{x}$, maps the
                    punctured plane $\nspace[2]\setminus\{(0,0)\}$ onto the unit
                    circle. To complete our deformation retraction we drag the
                    point $\vector{x}\ne\vector{0}$ along the straight line
                    between $\vector{x}$ and $h(\vector{x})$. We have:
                    \begin{equation}
                        H(\vector{x},t)
                        =(1-t)\cdot\vector{x}+t\cdot{h}(\vector{x})
                    \end{equation}
                    This is a deformation retract since elements of the unit
                    circle are held fixed for all $t\in[0,1]$. If
                    $\vector{s}\in\nsphere[1]$, then by definition
                    $\norm{\vector{s}}_{2}=1$ and hence
                    $h(\vector{s})=\vector{s}$. Simplifying, we have:
                    \begin{equation}
                        H(\vector{s},t)=(1-t)\cdot\vector{s}+t\cdot\vector{s}
                            =\vector{s}
                    \end{equation}
                    Thus $H$ gives us a deformation retraction of the punctured
                    plane onto the unit circle. We can do the same deformation
                    retraction with an annulus if we simply restrict $h$ to that
                    domain (see Fig.~\ref{fig:Def_Retract_Annulus_to_Circle}).
                \end{example}
                \par
                \begin{minipage}[t]{0.54\textwidth}
                    This family does not give us a homeomorphism since these
                    spaces are not homeomorphic. This shows deformation
                    retractions are, in general, weaker. For our second example
                    we must first define what a M\"{o}bius strip is. Similar to
                    how th torus was defined by gluing together parts
                    of the unit square, so is the M\"{o}bius strip but with a
                    twist introduced. Explicity, we take $[0,1]\times[0,1]$ and
                    identify $(0,y)$ with $(1,1-y)$, leaving $x$ alone. This
                    processed is outlined in
                    Fig.~\ref{fig:Square_to_Mobius_Strip}. The outcome is a
                    manifold with boundary. There is an inner circle that we can
                    retract the space to.

                It is perhaps best if we depict this with a 3D drawing. To do so
                we embed the M\"{o}bius strip into $\nspace[3]$ using the
                following maps. First define $r:[0,1]^{2}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$
                by:
                \begin{equation}
                    r(x,\,y)=1+\frac{2y-1}{2}\cos(\pi{x})
                \end{equation}
                The embedding is then given by:
                \begin{equation}
                    \varphi(x,y)=
                    \big(r(x,\,y)\cos(2\pi{x}),\,
                         r(x,\,y)\sin(2\pi{x}),\,
                         \frac{y}{2}\sin(\pi{x})\big)
                \end{equation}
                The domain is $[0,1]\times[0,1]$. The inner circle is
                obtained when $y=1/2$. To see that it is an embedding we need
                only show that $\varphi$ is injective and continuous. Since
                the M\"{o}bius strip is the quotient of a compact space, it is
                also compact. But $\nspace[3]$ is Hausdorff, and hence any
                injective function $\varphi$ from a compact space into $\nspace$
                will be a homeomorphism onto its image. We note that this is
                both continuous and injective simply by drawing its image
                (Fig.~\ref{fig:Def_Retract_Mobius_Strip}). This figure also
                depicts a deformation retraction down to the inner circle.
                An explicit homotopy is given by
                $H\big((x,\,y),\,t\big)=\varphi\big(x,\,(1-t)y+t/2\big)$.

                Subspaces which we retract a space onto need not be unique, nor
                need they be homeomorphic. Indeed, any space can be deformation
                retracted to itself by the function $H(x,t)=\identity{X}(x)$.
                As noted the annulus is not homeomorphic to the circle but both
                are deformation retractions of the same space. There are more
                subtle examples which we describe now. Consider the plane
                $\nspace[2]$ with two holes in it, say at $(\minus{1},0)$ and
                $(1,0)$. There is a deformation retraction of this space onto a
                figure eight. For the definition of a figure eight let's use the
                lemniscate of Gerono, studied by the French mathematician
                Camille-Christophe Gerono in the $19^{th}$ century C.E. The
                defining implicit equation goes as follows:
                \begin{equation}
                    x^{4}-x^{2}+y^{2}=0
                \end{equation}
                Setting $x(\theta)=\cos(\theta)$, we have:
                \begin{equation}
                    y^{2}=\cos^{2}(\theta)\big(1-\cos^{2}(\theta)\big)
                         =\cos^{2}(\theta)\sin^{2}(\theta)
                \end{equation}
                so we parameterize the figure eight by:
                \begin{equation}
                    \big(x(\theta),\,y(\theta)\big)
                        =\big(\cos(\theta),\,\cos(\theta)\sin(\theta)\big)
                \end{equation}
                Now we must retract the doubly punctured plane onto this object
                whilst leaving the lemniscate fixed. First suppose we've
                retracted all far away points down to an oval, and points near
                the two holes we've pushed out so that the holes have been
                enlarged from points to discs. To finish the retraction we use a
                bit of physics and differential equations
                (Fig.~\ref{fig:Deformation_Retraction_lemniscate_of_Gerono}).

                We put two identical electric charges at the centers of the blue
                circles. The \textit{electric field} exerted at a point
                $\vector{x}=(x_{0},y_{0})$ is given by Coulomb's law:
                \begin{equation}
                    F(\vector{x})=
                    \frac{\vector{x}-\vector{r}_{1}}
                         {\norm{\vector{x}-\vector{r}_{1}}_{2}^{3}}+
                    \frac{\vector{x}-\vector{r}_{2}}
                         {\norm{\vector{x}-\vector{r}_{2}}_{2}^{3}}
                \end{equation}
                where $\vector{r}_{1}$ and $\vector{r}_{2}$ are the coordinates
                of the holes, we've chosen $(\minus{1},0)$ and $(1,0)$. The
                notation $\norm{\vector{x}}_{2}^{3}$ denotes the 2-norm raised
                to the third power. If this were an actual physics problem we
                would need some scale factor $Q/4\pi\epsilon_{0}$, but for our
                purposes we simply need the directions of the
                \textit{field lines}. Given a point inside of the lemniscate, we
                drag this continuously outward along field lines until we hit
                the figure eight, and for points on the outside we contract
                inwards. All the while we leave the lemniscate fixed. The
                outcome is a deformation retraction onto our figure eight. For
                the sake of computation one could use Euler's method of solving
                differential equations to numerically approximate this
                procedure.

                closed form solutions we can use Cassini ovals. If we let $a$
                denote the distance from the first hole to the second, we can
                study the family of curves satisfying the following equation:
                \begin{equation}
                    \label{eqn:Cassini_Ovals}%
                    \big((x-a)^{2}+y^{2}\big)\big((x+a)^{2}+y^{2}\big)=b^{4}
                \end{equation}
                this asks for the set of all points $P$ such that the distance
                from $P$ to the first hole multiplied by the distance from $P$
                to the second hole is equal to $b^{2}$:
                \begin{equation}
                    X_{b}=\{\,\vector{x}\in\nspace[2]\;|\;
                        \norm{\vector{x}-\vector{r}_{1}}_{2}\cdot
                        \norm{\vector{x}-\vector{r}_{2}}_{2}=b^{2}\,\}
                \end{equation}
                This was studied by the Italian astronomer Giovanni Domenico
                Cassini in 1680 C.E. and gives a continuous means of retracting
                the plane with two holes onto a figure eight. The resulting
                figure eight is no longer the lemniscate of Gerono, but rather
                the lemniscate of Bernoulli, studied by Jakob Bernoulli in
                1694 C.E. shortly after Cassini's investigations.
                Taking the gradient of Eqn.~\ref{eqn:Cassini_Ovals} gives us a
                vector field that allows one to flow along field lines until we
                arrive at the lemniscate
                (Fig.~\ref{fig:Deformation_Retraction_Cassini_Ovals}). The
                gradient is computed to be:
                \begin{equation}
                    \grad{f}=\big(4x(x^{2}+y^{2}-a^{2}),4y(x^{2}+y^{2}+a^2)\big)
                \end{equation}
                The gradient shows what the paths of individual points will look
                like, and allows us to draw
                Fig.~\ref{fig:Deformation_Retraction_Cassini_Ovals}, but is
                unnecessary. Cassini's equation Eqn.~\ref{eqn:Cassini_Ovals} is
                all we need. As $b$ tends to zero we get two disconnected ovals
                closing in on our points. When $b$ is equal to the square root
                of the distance between these points we obtain the lemniscate,
                and as $b$ grows we get a single connected object that looks
                like an ellipse as $b$ gets large. This is precisely the
                description of a deformation retraction of the plane with two
                points missing onto the figure eight and the intermediate steps
                are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Homotopy_Cassini_Ovals}.

                Now we can use our imagination to consider other possible
                deformation retractions from the plane with two holes onto
                smaller subspaces. For one, we can take our central lemniscate
                of Bernoulli that was produced in
                Fig.~\ref{fig:Deformation_Retraction_Cassini_Ovals} using
                Cassini ovals and stretch the crossing point outwards until we
                achieve two circles attached by a straight line
                (see Fig.~\ref{fig:Homotopy_Two_Circles_and_String}). While the
                retracts using electric fields and Cassini ovals result in
                homeomorphic objects (the lemniscates of Gerono and  Bernoulli
                are homeomorphic subspaces of $\nspace[2]$), this third object
                is \textit{not} homeomorphic to either of these. Suppose $f$ is
                a homeomorphism from the lemniscate of Bernoulli to two circles
                with a straight line. If we remove the center of the lemniscate
                we are left with two subspaces that are homeomorphic to the open
                unit interval $(0,1)$. However, no matter where the crossing
                point maps to under $f$ removing a single point from the latter
                object does not result in two homeomorphic copies of the unit
                interval, even though homeomorphisms preserve this notion of
                subspace. So while these are both the result of deformation
                retractions of the same space, they are not homeomorphic.
                \par\hfill\par
                Further still we can imagine stretching the crossing point of
                our lemniscate vertically rather than horizontally, obtaining
                Fig.~\ref{fig:Homotopy_Oval_with_Line}. It is perhaps easiest to
                see that this retraction is different then
                Fig.~\ref{fig:Deformation_Retraction_Cassini_Ovals} and
                Fig.~\ref{fig:Homotopy_Two_Circles_and_String}. Removing
                any point from this final figure eight does not disconnect it,
                however if we remove the central points from either the
                lemniscate of Bernoulli or the circles connected by a line we
                would disconnect these spaces into two separate parts. Since
                homeomorphisms preserve subspaces, this final object is not
                homeomorphic to either of the other two. So none of these things
                are homeomorphic to each other, though they are
                \textit{homotopy equivalent}, a notion we will soon desribe.

                The previous examples involving the doubly punctured plane give
                rise to another notion, the \textit{mapping cylinder} of a
                function $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$. We take our domain $X$ and cross
                it with the closed unit interval $I=[0,1]$. If $X$ happens to be
                the circle $\nsphere[1]$ then $X\times{I}$ is precisely a
                cylinder. We take $X\times{I}$ with the product topology and
                consider the \textit{disjoint union} of this space with $Y$,
                denoted $(X\times{I})\coprod{Y}$. Set theoretically this is
                written as follows:
                \begin{equation}
                    \label{eqn:Def_Disjoint_Union}%
                    A\coprod{B}=(A\times\{0\})\cup(B\times\{1\})
                \end{equation}
                That is, we take a copy of $A$ and a copy of $B$ and form a
                new set that contains $A$ and $B$ as separate entities. For
                example, the disjoint union of $\nsphere[1]$ with $\nsphere[2]$
                can be thought of as a circle with a sphere placed far away.
                This is contrasted with the usual union
                $\nsphere[1]\cup\nsphere[2]$ which is just the sphere
                $\nsphere[2]$ since the unit circle is a subset of the unit
                sphere (it's the equator). The disjoint union topology mimics
                this newer notion. An open set is $A\coprod{B}$ is just an open
                set in $A$ plus an open set in $B$. The mapping cylinder is
                obtained by equipping the space $(X\times{I})\coprod{Y}$ with
                the equivalence relation $R$ identifying $(x,1)\in{X}\times{I}$
                and $f(x)\in{Y}$. We \textit{glue} the bottom of our cylinder
                onto the image of $X$ in $Y$ by $f$.
                \begin{fdefinition}{Mapping Cylinder}{Mapping_Cylinder}
                    The mapping cylinder of a continuous function $f$ from a
                    topological space $\topspace[X]{X}$ into a topological space
                    $\topspace[Y]{Y}$ is the quotient space induced on
                    $(X\times{I})\coprod{Y}$ by the equivalence relation $R$
                    obtained by identifying $\big((x,1),\,0\big)$ with
                    $\big(f(x),\,1\big)$ for all $x\in{X}$.
                \end{fdefinition}
                An explaination on the notation. By
                Eqn.~\ref{eqn:Def_Disjoint_Union} an element of $A\coprod{B}$ is
                of the form $(z,i)$ where $i=0$ or $i=1$, and either $z\in{A}$
                or $z\in{B}$, depending on $i$. Since we're taking the disjoint
                union of a product $(X\times{I})\coprod{Y}$ the elements are of
                the form $(z,i)$ where either $z=(x,t)\in{X}\times{I}$ or
                $z=y\in{Y}$. Technicalities aside, we present an example. If
                $X=\nsphere[1]$ then $X\times{I}$ is an actual cylinder. We map
                $X$ into $\nspace[2]$ by defining:
                \begin{equation}
                    \label{eqn:Trefoil_Mapping_Cylinder}%
                    f(\theta)=\Big(
                        \frac{1+\cos^{2}\big(\frac{3\theta}{2}\big)}{2},\,
                        \theta
                    \Big)
                \end{equation}
                using polar coordinates. The result is a trefoil. First, we draw
                the space $(X\times{I})\coprod{Y}$. Since this is
                the disjoint union we think of $\nsphere[1]\times{I}$ and
                $\nspace[2]$ as separate entities
                (Fig.~\ref{fig:Ex_Mapping_Cylinder_Disj_Union}).
                \begin{figure}

                \end{figure}
                We've drawn the image of $\nsphere[1]$ under the mapping
                defined in Eqn.~\ref{eqn:Trefoil_Mapping_Cylinder} in blue to
                help transition to the next part of the process. To create the
                mapping cylinder we glue the \textit{bottom} of
                $\nsphere[1]\times{I}$ (the bottom being a copy of
                $\nsphere[1]$, i.e. the \textit{boundary}) onto this blue piece
                using the function $f$ to guide us in the gluing. We can be very
                explicit if we imagine this in $\nspace[3]$. We draw the top
                circle in the $z=1$ plane and then draw a straight line between
                $\big(\cos(\theta),\sin(\theta),1\big)$ to the point $f(\theta)$
                which lies in the $xy$ plane. After drawing a straight line for
                every $\theta\in[0,2\pi)$ we arrive at our mapping cylinder
                (Fig.~\ref{fig:Ex_Mapping_Cylinder}).
                \begin{figure}[H]

                \end{figure}
                The red circle at the top represents $\nsphere[1]$, the blue
                closed curve in the plane is $f[\nsphere[1]]$ and the gray
                surface is our mapping cylinder. The black mesh lines simply
                emphasize the construction. It's important to note per
                definition the mapping cylinder includes the entire plane
                $\nspace[2]$ as well. This straight-line construction
                generalizes. Given a mapping cylinder induced by
                $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ we can shrink the cylindrical portion
                downwards giving us a deformation retraction onto $Y$.
                \par\hfill\par
                Not all deformation retractions come from mapping cylinders.
                Suppose we take a thick $\textbf{X}$ and shrink it down to a
                skinny X. We then shrink this X down to the central crossing
                point. Combining these two deformation retractions gives us a
                single deformation retraction $\textbf{X}$ to $\cdot$ but this
                cannot arise from a mapping cylinder since paths must merge
                together halfway through the deformation.
            \subsection{Homotopy}
                Deformation retractions and mapping cylinders motivate a far
                more general concept, though the real motivation stems from the
                desire to replace homeomorphism with an easily computable
                notion which preserves many properties.
                \par\hfill\par
                \begin{minipage}[t]{0.50\textwidth}
                    Homeomorphism is an ideal definition of sameness, but many
                    spaces that are not homeomorphic share many properties. We
                    expand our study of topology by defining
                    \textit{homotopy equivalence}. We will show homeomorphisms
                    are stronger (i.e. homeomorphic implies homotopy
                    equivalent) and demonstrate the converse fails.

                    A homotopy from a continuous function $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ to
                    a continuous function $g:X\rightarrow{Y}$ with respect to
                    topological spaces $\topspace[X]{X}$ and $\topspace[Y]{Y}$
                    is a continuous function $H:{X}\times{I}\rightarrow{Y}$ such
                    that $H(x,0)=f(x)$ and $H(x,1)=g(x)$, where $I=[0,1]$ is the
                    closed unit interval and $X\times{I}$ carries the product
                    topology $\tau_{X}\times\tau_{\nspace[]}|_{I}$.
                \end{fdefinition}
                To clarify, $\tau_{\nspace[]}$ is the standard Euclidean
                topology on $\nspace[]$ and $\tau_{\nspace[]}|_{I}$ is the
                subspace topology induced on the closed unit interval $I$. Given
                $f,g:X\rightarrow{Y}$ we drag $f$ along a continuous path in
                $X\times{I}$ until we obtain the function $g$
                (see Fig.~\ref{fig:Homotopy_Diagram_for_Depicting_Homotopy}).
                Homotopy is very weak since, as we will see, \textit{every} pair
                of continuous functions $f,g:\nspace[m]\rightarrow\nspace$ has a
                homotopy between them. Indeed, we can be more general and
                prove this for \textit{topological vector spaces} over the real
                numbers. This is just a vector space with a topology that makes
                vector addition and scalar multiplication \textit{continuous}
                operations. Any topological vector space over $\mathbb{R}$ is
                path connected since $\gamma:[0,1]\rightarrow{X}$ defined by
                $\gamma(t)=(1-t)\cdot{x}+t\cdot{y}$ is a continuous path from
                $x$ to $y$. We use this map to define our homotopy.
                \begin{theorem}
                    If $\topspace[X]{X}$ is a topological space, if
                    $\topvecspace[Y]{Y}$ is a topological vector space over the
                    real numbers, and if $f,g:X\rightarrow{Y}$ are continuous
                    functions, then there is a homotopy
                    $H:X\times{I}\rightarrow{Y}$ from $f$ to $g$.
                \end{theorem}
                \begin{proof}
                    For let $H$ be defined by:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eqn:Straight_Line_Homotopy}%
                        H(x,t)=(1-t)\cdot{f}(x)\vecadd[Y]t\cdot{g}(x)
                    \end{equation}
                    Since $Y$ is a topological vector space, $H$ is well defined
                    for all $x\in{X}$ and $t\in[0,1]$. Moreover, $H(x,0)=f(x)$,
                    $H(x,1)=g(x)$ and $H$ is continuous. Hence, $H$ is a
                    homotopy taking $f$ to $g$.
                \end{proof}
                \begin{example}
                    \label{ex:Straight_Line_Homotopy_Euc_Spaces}%
                    The simplest homotopy involves convex subsets of Euclidean
                    spaces where we may again define the \textit{straight line}
                    homotopy. Given two continuous functions
                    $f,g:X\rightarrow\mathcal{U}$ from a topological space $X$
                    to a convex subset of $\nspace$ we write
                    $H(x,t)=f(x)(1-t)+g(x)t$. This is well defined since by
                    hypothesis the space is convex and $H(x,t)$ represents a
                    straight line between $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ for each point
                    $x\in{X}$. Thus, $H$ is a homotopy from $f$ to $g$. It is
                    too demanding to ask one to only consider convex spaces, but
                    any topological space that is homeomorphic to a convex
                    subset of $\nspace$ can inherit this homotopy by using
                    function composition with the hypothesized homeomorphism. A
                    more general notion is that the space be
                    \textit{contractible} meaning it can be deformed
                    continuously to a single point.
                \end{example}
                With homotopy now defined, we should redundantly define
                \textit{homotopic} functions (functions with a homotopy between
                them). To avoid abuse of language we must first show that if
                there is a homotopy from $f$ to $g$, then there is a homotopy
                from $g$ to $f$. That is, we need not specify which function is
                the \textit{first} one.
                \begin{ltheorem}{Symmetry of Homotopy}{Symmetry_of_Homotopy}
                    If $\topspace[X]{X}$ and $\topspace[Y]{Y}$ are topological
                    spaces, if $f,g:X\rightarrow{Y}$ are continuous, and if $H$
                    is a homotopy from $f$ to $g$, then there is a homotopy
                    from $g$ to $f$.
                \end{ltheorem}
                \begin{proof}
                    For let $G:X\times{I}\rightarrow{Y}$ be defined by:
                    \begin{equation}
                        G(x,t)=H(x,1-t)
                    \end{equation}
                    for all $x\in{X}$ and $t\in[0,1]$. Then $G$ is the
                    composition of continuous functions and is therefore
                    continuous. By definition $G(x,0)=H(x,1)=g(x)$ and
                    $G(x,1)=H(x,0)=f(x)$. Hence $G$ is a homotopy taking $g$ to
                    $f$.
                \end{proof}
                We may now define \textit{homotopic}.
                \begin{fdefinition}{Homotopic Functions}{Homotopic_Functions}
                    Homotopic functions from a topological space
                    $\topspace[X]{X}$ to a topological space $\topspace[Y]{Y}$
                    are continuous functions $f,g:{X}\rightarrow{Y}$ such that
                    there is a homotopy $H$ between them.
                \end{fdefinition}
                Homotopic is an equivalence relation. We have shown that it is
                symmetric, next we show reflexivity.
                \begin{ltheorem}{Reflexivity of Homotopy}
                                {Reflexivity_of_Homotopy}
                    If $\topspace[X]{X}$ and $\topspace[Y]{Y}$ are topological
                    spaces, and if $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ is a continuous function,
                    then $f$ is homotopic to $f$.
                \end{ltheorem}
                \begin{proof}
                    For let $H:X\times{I}\rightarrow{Y}$ be defined by
                    $H(x,t)=f(x)$. Then $H$ is continuous, $H(x,0)=f(x)$ and
                    $H(x,1)=f(x)$. Thus $f$ is homotopic to $f$.
                \end{proof}
                We complete our claim that homotopic is an equivalence relation
                by proving it is transitive. We'll need the
                \textit{pasting lemma} from point-set topology.
                \begin{ltheorem}{Transitivity of Homotopy}
                                {Transitivity_of_Homotopy}
                    If $\topspace[X]{X}$ and $\topspace[Y]{Y}$ are topological
                    spaces, if $f,g,h:X\rightarrow{Y}$ are continuous, if $f$ is
                    homotopic to $g$, and if $g$ is homotopic to $h$, then $f$
                    is homotopic to $h$.
                \end{ltheorem}
                \begin{proof}
                    If $f$ is homotopic to $g$ and $g$ is homotopic to $h$, then
                    there exist continuous functions
                    $H_{1},H_{2}:X\times{I}\rightarrow{Y}$ such that $H_{1}$ is
                    a homotopy from $f$ to $g$ and $H_{2}$ is a homotopy from
                    $g$ to $h$. Let $H:X\times{I}\rightarrow{Y}$ be defined by:
                    \begin{equation}
                        H(x,t)=
                        \begin{cases}
                            H_{1}(x,2t),&{0}\leq{t}\leq\frac{1}{2}\\
                            H_{2}(x,2t-1),&\frac{1}{2}<{t}\leq{1}
                        \end{cases}
                    \end{equation}
                    By the pasting lemma, $H$ is continuous. But from the
                    definition of $H_{1}$ and $H_{2}$, $H(x,0)=f(x)$ and
                    $H(x,1)=h(x)$. Thus, $f$ is homotopic to $h$.
                \end{proof}

                \begin{lexample}{Straight Line Homotopy}{Straight_Line_Homotopy}
                    We saw in Ex.~\ref{ex:Straight_Line_Homotopy_Euc_Spaces}
                    that for any pair of continuous functions
                    $f,g:\nspace[m]\rightarrow\nspace$ there is a homotopy
                    between them, and hence all continuous functions between
                    Euclidean spaces are homotopic. For a more concrete example,
                    let's define two functions
                    $f,g:\nspace[]\rightarrow\nspace[2]$ by:
                    \twocolumneq{f(x)=\big(x,\,x^{3}\big)}
                                {g(x)=\big(x,\,\exp(x)\big)}
                    Both of these are continuous since they are continuous in
                    each coordinate. We can use the straight line homotopy
                    between them:
                    \begin{subequations}
                        \begin{align}
                            H(x,t)
                            &=(1-t)\big(x,\,x^{3}\big)+t\big(x,\,\exp(x)\big)\\
                            &=\big(x,\,(1-t)x^{3}+t\exp(x)\big)
                        \end{align}
                    \end{subequations}
                    The latter equation gives a parameterization of curves in
                    the plane that we can draw. The paths are shown in
                    Fig.~\ref{fig:Paths_Representing_Homotopy}. Note
                    $g(x)=constant$ is possible. Any continuous function
                    $f:\nspace[m]\rightarrow\nspace$ is homotopic to a point.
                \end{lexample}
                \begin{minipage}{0.56\textwidth}
                    Lastly, we can visualize homotopy by letting $X=I$ and
                    $Y\subset\nspace[2]$ be a nice blob, like the one in
                    Fig.~\ref{fig:straight_line_homotopy}. In this setting
                    continuous functions $f,g:[0,1]\rightarrow{Y}$ are just
                    curves within the blob. The homotopy defined in
                    Eqn.~\ref{eqn:Straight_Line_Homotopy} is the map taking
                    $f(x)$ to $g(x)$ via the straight line between them. We may
                    use homotopy to precisely define deformation retractions.
                    First, we define \textit{retracts}.

                \begin{fdefinition}{Retract}{Retract}
                    A retract of a topological space $\topspace{X}$ to a
                    subspace $A\subseteq{X}$ is a continuous function
                    $f:X\rightarrow{A}$ such that $f|_{A}=\identity{A}$.
                \end{fdefinition}
                If $f:X\rightarrow{A}$ is a retract, then composing twice simply
                yields $f$ again. That is, $f^{2}=f$. In a way retractions mimic
                projections that occur in linear algebra.
                \begin{example}
                    Let's look at the example of the annulus deformation
                    retracting down to a circle. The key mapping was the unit
                    vector function:
                    \begin{equation}
                        h(\vector{x})=\frac{\vector{x}}{\norm{\vector{x}}_{2}}
                    \end{equation}
                    This function is a \textit{retract} of the punctured plane
                    $\nspace[2]\setminus\{(0,0)\}$ to the circle $\nsphere[1]$.
                    The deformation retract was then defined by:
                    \begin{equation}
                        H(\vector{x},t)
                            =(1-t)\cdot\vector{x}+t\cdot{h}(\vector{x})
                    \end{equation}
                    But this is just the straight-line homotopy between the
                    retract $h$ and the identity function
                    $\identity{X}$, where $X=\nspace[2]\setminus\{(0,0)\}$ is
                    the punctured plane:
                    \begin{equation}
                        H(\vector{x},t)=(1-t)\cdot\identity{X}(\vector{x})+
                            t\cdot{h}(\vector{x})
                    \end{equation}
                \end{example}
                The above example spells out how we can define a deformation
                retraction.
                \begin{fdefinition}{Deformation Retraction}
                                   {Deformation_Retraction}
                    A deformation retraction of a topological space
                    $\topspace{X}$ onto a subspace $A\subseteq{X}$ is a
                    homotopy $H:X\times{I}\rightarrow{X}$ between the identity
                    function $\identity{X}$ and a retract $f:X\rightarrow{A}$.
                \end{fdefinition}
                We've omitted the requirement that $H(a,t)=a$ for all $a\in{A}$
                and $t\in{I}$. This more general concept is a \textit{weak}
                deformation contraction where the set $A$ is
                allowed to move throughout the homotopy. The notion previously
                discussed is then called a \textit{strong} deformation
                retraction. There are bizarre spaces with weak deformation
                retractions that cannot be obtained by strong ones. One such
                example is the comb space. We take the closed unit
                interval $[0,1]$ sitting in $\nspace[2]$ and attached
                $\{\frac{1}{n}\}\times[0,1]$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}^{+}$.
                Lastly we attach $\{0\}\times[0,1]$.

                \begin{minipage}[t]{0.54\textwidth}
                    We give this the usual subspace topology of which makes it
                    very nice from a point-set topology view (it's compact, path
                    connected, etc.). It is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Comb_Space}.
                    There are a plethora of points which this space deformation
                    retracts to, for example the point in the bottom right
                    corner. We can push down all of the teeth of the comb and
                    then compress the resulting line to the right. Similarly,
                    just about every other point can be deformation retracted
                    to. One point that \textit{cannot} is the top left corner.
                    To see this, note that a deformation retract $H$ is a
                    continuous function.

                If we consider the sequence $a_{n}=(\frac{1}{n},1)$ this
                converges to $(0,1)$. Hence $H(a_{n},t)$ must converge to
                $(0,1)$ for all $t$ since $H$ does not move the point $(0,1)$.
                But this sequence must be pressed downwards to the $x$ axis
                during the deformation, a contradiction. We can
                \textit{weakly} deformation retract to this point. First we push
                all of the teeth down to the $x$ axis and then squish the
                resulting line segment to the origin. We conclude by dragging
                this point back to $(0,1)$. This is a weak deformation
                retraction since we allowed the point of retraction to move.
                It is worthwhile pointing out some subtle differences between
                \textit{retracts} and \textit{deformation retractions}. For one,
                any space retracts to a single point.
                \begin{theorem}
                    If $\topspace{X}$ is a topological space, and if
                    $x_{0}\in{X}$, then there is a retract
                    $f:X\rightarrow\{x_{0}\}$.
                \end{theorem}
                \begin{proof}
                    For let $f:X\rightarrow\{x_{0}\}$ be defined in the only way
                    possible: $f(x)=x_{0}$. Then since $f$ is a constant
                    function it is continuous. But
                    $f|_{\{x_{0}\}}=\identity{\{x_{0}\}}$ and hence $f$ is a
                    retract of $X$ to $\{x_{0}\}$.
                \end{proof}
                It is \textit{not} true that every space can be deformation
                retracted to a point. As we will see, it is necessary that
                such spaces be connected, and moreover path connected. Hence any
                disconnected space can be retracted down to a point but cannot
                be deformation retracted. Path connectedness is not a sufficient
                condition since the punctured plane is path connected but has
                no deformation retraction to a point. The intuitive reason
                being there is a \textit{hole} in the space.
                \begin{fdefinition}{Relative Homotopy}{Relative_Homotopy}
                    A homotopy relative to a subspace $A\subseteq{X}$ between
                    continuous functions $f,g:X\rightarrow{Y}$ with respect to
                    topological spaces $\topspace[X]{X}$ and $\topspace[Y]{Y}$
                    is a homotopy $H:X\times{I}\rightarrow{Y}$ between $f$ and
                    $g$ such that for all $t\in[0,1]$ and for all $a\in{A}$ it
                    is true that $H(a,t)=f(a)$ and $H(a,t)=g(a)$.
                \end{fdefinition}
                For a relative homotopy to exist between $f$ and $g$ it is
                necessary that $f|_{A}=g|_{A}$, otherwise this definition does
                not make sense. We may concisely define \textit{strong}
                deformation retractions to be relative homotopies
                $H:X\times{I}\rightarrow{X}$ with respect to a subspace
                $A\subseteq{X}$ between the identity function $\identity{X}$ and
                a retract.

                Various examples have shown us that homotopic functions can look
                very different. Indeed, \textit{every} pair of continuous
                functions $f,g:\nspace[m]\rightarrow\nspace$ are homotopic. The
                definition of homeomorphism states that $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ is
                a homeomorphism if and only if $f$ is a continuous bijection
                with a continuous inverse. We also saw that it was not enough to
                say that there exists a continuous bijection $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$
                and another continuous bijection $g:Y\rightarrow{X}$. However,
                it is equivalent that there are continuous bijections
                $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ and $g:Y\rightarrow{X}$ with
                $f\circ{g}=\identity{Y}$ and $g\circ{f}=\identity{X}$. This last
                condition merely stating that $g=f^{\minus{1}}$. A new form of
                sameness for topological spaces is given if we relax the
                \textit{equalities} $f\circ{g}=\identity{Y}$ and
                $g\circ{f}=\identity{X}$ and instead only require
                \textit{homotopic}. We give this a name:
                \begin{fdefinition}{Homotopy Inverse}{Homotopy_Inverse}
                    A homotopy inverse of a continuous function
                    $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ from a topological space
                    $\topspace[X]{X}$ to $\topspace[Y]{Y}$ is a continuous
                    function $g:Y\rightarrow{X}$ such that $g\circ{f}$ is
                    homotopic to $\identity{X}$ and $f\circ{g}$ is homotopic to
                    $\identity{Y}$.
                \end{fdefinition}
                There's often a notion of uniqueness when it comes to inverses,
                and indeed a homotopy inverse of a function $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$
                is unique \textit{up to homotopy}.
                \begin{theorem}
                    If $\topspace[X]{X}$ and $\topspace[Y]{Y}$ are topological
                    spaces, if $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ is continuous, and if
                    $g_{1},g_{2}:Y\rightarrow{X}$ are homotopy inverses
                    of $f$, then $g_{1}$ is homotopic to ${g}_{2}$.
                \end{theorem}
                \begin{proof}
                    Since $g_{2}$ is a homotopy inverse of $f$,
                    $f\circ{g}_{2}$ is homotopic to $\identity{Y}$. But homotopy
                    is reflexive and hence $g_{1}$ is homotopic to itself, and
                    $g_{1}=g_{1}\circ\identity{Y}$. But homotopy is transitive
                    so if $g_{1}$ is homotopic $g_{1}\circ\identity{Y}$ and
                    $g_{1}\circ\identity{Y}$ is homotopic to
                    $g_{1}\circ(f\circ{g}_{2})$, then $g_{1}$ is homotopic to
                    $g_{1}\circ(f\circ{g}_{2})$. But function composition is
                    associative, thus
                    $g_{1}\circ(f\circ{g}_{2})=(g_{1}\circ{f})\circ{g}_{2}$.
                    But $g_{1}$ is a homotopy inverse of $f$, and therefore
                    $g_{1}\circ{f}$ is homotopic to $\identity{X}$. Hence
                    $(g_{1}\circ{f})\circ{g}_{2}$ is homotopic to ${g}_{2}$ and
                    since homotopic is a transitive relation, $g_{1}$ is
                    homotopic to ${g}_{2}$.
                \end{proof}
                Often in mathematics we wish to be as lazy as possible. If
                $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ and $g:Y\rightarrow{X}$ are continuous
                bijections, and if $g\circ{f}=\identity{X}$, then there is no
                need to check if $f\circ{g}=\identity{Y}$. This comes for free
                from set theory. This is not so for homotopy inverses as the
                following example demonstrates.
                \begin{example}
                    Let $X=\{0\}$ be the one point space and $Y=\mathbb{Q}$.
                    Define $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ by $f(0)=0$ and
                    $g:Y\rightarrow{X}$ by $g(x)=0$. Then both $f$ and $g$ are
                    continuous function, and $g\circ{f}=\identity{X}$, which is
                    certainly homotopic to $\identity{X}$. However, $f\circ{g}$
                    is \textit{not} homotopic to $\identity{\mathbb{Q}}$ for if
                    it were then $\mathbb{Q}$ would be \textit{contractible}. As
                    stated one of the requirements for a space to be contractible
                    is that it is path connected, whereas $\mathbb{Q}$ is
                    totally disconnected. Hence $f$ and $g$ are both continuous,
                    $g\circ{f}$ is homotopic to $\identity{X}$, but
                    $f\circ{g}$ is not homotopic to $\identity{Y}$. Another
                    point of disagreement between homeomorphism and homotopy.
                \end{example}
                \begin{fdefinition}{Homotopy Equivalence}{Homotopy_Equivalence}
                    A homotopy equivalence from a topological space
                    $\topspace[X]{X}$ to a topological space $\topspace[Y]{Y}$
                    is a continuous function $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ such that there
                    exists a homotopy inverse $g:Y\rightarrow{X}$ of $f$.
                \end{fdefinition}
                It is important to note it is not required that
                $g\circ{f}=id_{X}$, but rather $g\circ{f}$ is \textit{homotopic}
                to the identity map $\identity{X}$. Similarly, $f\circ{g}$ need
                only be homotopic to $\identity{Y}$. Let's look at an example of
                the types of operations permitted by homotopy equivalences.
                First we take a torus with a disk wedged inside
                (Fig.~\ref{fig:Torus_with_Disc_Inside}). Next we'll shrink the
                disk down to a point, leaving the rest of the torus alone
                (Fig.~\ref{fig:Squished_Torus}). Such moves are not permitted by
                homeomorphisms since we are squeezing infinitely many elements
                together and identifying them with a single point, whereas
                homeomorphisms must be bijective per definition.
                \textit{Homotopy} does allow us to perform such an operation.
                \begin{figure}[H]
                    \centering
                    \captionsetup{type=figure}
                    \includegraphics{images/Torus_Wireframe_Gradient.pdf}
                    \caption{Torus with a Disk Inside}
                    \label{fig:Torus_with_Disc_Inside}
                \end{figure}
                This can be made more concrete with equations since
                parametrizations of the torus are well known. If we let $R$ and
                $r$ denote the outer and inner radii, respectively, we have:
                \begin{subequations}
                    \begin{align}
                        x(\theta,\varphi)
                            &=\big(R+r\cos(\varphi)\big)\cos(\theta)\\
                        y(\theta,\varphi)
                            &=\big(R+r\cos(\varphi)\big)\sin(\theta)\\
                        z(\theta,\varphi)&=r\sin(\varphi)
                    \end{align}
                \end{subequations}
                The squished torus can be obtain by shrinking the $x$ and $z$
                coordinates as $y$ varies. The code used to generate
                Fig.~\ref{fig:Squished_Torus} adopted the following:
                \begin{subequations}
                    \begin{align}
                        x(\theta,\varphi)
                            &=\big(R+r\cos(\varphi)\sin(\tfrac{\theta}{2})\big)
                                \cos(\theta)\\
                        y(\theta,\varphi)
                            &=\big(R+r\cos(\varphi)\big)\sin(\theta)\\
                        z(\theta,\varphi)
                            &=r\sin(\varphi)\sin(\tfrac{\theta}{2})
                    \end{align}
                \end{subequations}
                This shrinks the torus to a point when $\theta=0$ and has no
                effect at $\theta=\pi$, varying continuously in between which is
                precisely what we want. It is important to realize that we
                needed the disk inside the torus in order to perform this move.
                We are using the disk to do our squishing.

                    Continuing, one can imagine taking our croissant and
                    stretching out the collapsed point into a line obtaining a
                    crescent-moon with a line connecting the poles. We take the
                    body of this and morph it into a sphere, obtaining
                    Fig.~\ref{fig:Sphere_with_String_Attached}. From here we can
                    proceed and drag the endpoints of the string down towards
                    the equator and obtain Fig.~\ref{fig:Kettle_Bell}. This
                    example demonstrates how massively different spaces with
                    homotopy equivalences can be. Even the last two objects,
                    which perhaps look similar enough, are not homeomorphic.

                    Let's demonstrate this. Homeomorphisms preserve subspaces.
                    Using this, if we remove the attaching point of our kettle
                    bell we have a disconnected space. No matter which point we
                    remove from our sphere with string attached at the poles the
                    space remains connected, so these are not homeomorphic.
                    Just like homeomorphism gives rise to the notion of
                    homeomorphic, homotopy equivalence redundantly allows us to
                    define homotopy equivalent.

                As stated before, this is a weaker notion of sameness. It is
                important in algebraic topology since it preserves many notion.
                It should be noted that it is a strictly weaker notion than
                homeomorphism. Homeomorphic implies homotopy equivalent, but not

                    topological spaces, then they are homotopy equivalent.
                \end{ltheorem}
                \begin{proof}
                    For if $X$ and $Y$ are homeomorphic, then there exists a
                    homeomorphism $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$. But then $f$ is a
                    continuous map from $X$ to $Y$, and $f^{-1}$ is a continuous
                    map from $Y$ to $X$. Moreover,
                    ${f}\circ{f^{-1}}=\identity{Y}$, and
                    ${f^{-1}}\circ{f}=\identity{X}$ since $f$ is a bijection.
                    But $\identity{X}$ is homotopic to $\identity{X}$, and
                    $\identity{Y}$ is homotopic to $\identity{Y}$. Thus,
                    $f^{\minus{1}}$ is a homotopy inverse of $f$ so $f$ is a
                    homotopy equivalence.
                \end{proof}
                One of the great conjectures of mathematics, Poincar\'{e}'s
                Conjecture, asks when does the converse hold?
                It does not take much to show it may fail.
                \begin{theorem}
                    \label{thm:homotopic_does_not_imply_homeomorphic}%
                    There exist topological spaces that are homotopy equivalent
                    but not homeomorphic.
                \end{theorem}
                \begin{proof}
                    Let $X=\nspace[2]$ and $Y=\{(0,0)\}$ be equipped with their
                    usual topologies. Let $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ be defined by
                    $f(x,y)=(0,0)$ and $g=\identity{Y}$. Then
                    $g\circ{f}=\identity{Y}$. Let
                    $H\big((x,y),t\big)=(1-t)(x,y)$. Then $H$ is continuous,
                    $H\big((x,y),0\big)=(x,y)$, and $H\big((x,y),1\big)=(0,0)$.
                    Thus, $H$ is a homotopy between ${g}\circ{f}$ and
                    $\identity{X}$, and therefore ${g}\circ{f}$ is homotopic to
                    $\identity{X}$. But ${f}\circ{g}=\identity{Y}$ and
                    $\identity{Y}$ is homotopic to $\identity{Y}$. Thus $X$ and
                    $Y$ are homotopy equivalent. If $h:{X}\rightarrow{Y}$ is a
                    homeomorphism, then it is a bijection. But then
                    $\Card(X)=\Card(Y)$ where $\Card$ denotes the cardinality
                    of the space. But $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is uncountable, and
                    $\Card(Y)=1$, a contradiction. Therefore $X$ and $Y$ are not
                    homeomorphic.
                \end{proof}
                Fig.~\ref{fig:homotopy_equivalence_of_plane_with_point}
                shows the mapping $f$ between $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and $\{(0,0)\}$.
                This is a deformation retraction of $\nspace[2]$ to a single
                point. Such spaces are given a name.
                \begin{fdefinition}{Contractible}{Contractible}
                    A contractible topological space is a space $\topspace{X}$
                    that is homotopy equivalent to a one point space
                    $(\{0\},\{\emptyset,\{0\}\})$.

                \begin{minipage}{0.54\textwidth}
                    A one point space $X=\{0\}$ has only one topology on it,
                    $\tau=\{\emptyset,\{0\}\}$. This is the extreme case where
                    the discrete and indiscrete topologies are identical. The
                    fact that $\nspace[2]$ is contractible generalizes to all
                    dimensions, which we will show later.
                    Thm.~\ref{thm:homotopic_does_not_imply_homeomorphic} relies
                    on the fact that $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and $\{(0,0)\}$ are of
                    different \textit{cardinality}. Even if $X$ and $Y$ are
                    homotopy equivalent and of the same cardinality, it is still
                    possible that they are not homeomorphic. Recall
                    homeomorphisms preserve compactness. Homotopy equivalences
                    need not.

                    There exists topological spaces that have the same
                    cardinality, are homotopy equivalent, but not homeomorphic.
                \end{theorem}
                \begin{proof}
                    For let $X=\nspace[2]\setminus\{(0,0)\}$ and
                    $Y=\nsphere[1]$ have their usual topologies. Then
                    $\Card(X)=\Card(Y)=\Card(\mathbb{R})$, and thus both sets
                    are of the same cardinality. They are also homotopy
                    equivalent. Define $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ and
                    $g:Y\rightarrow{X}$ by:
                    \twocolumneq{f(x,y)=\frac{(x,y)}{\norm{(x,y)}}}
                                {g(x,y)=(x,y)}
                    $f$ is well defined since $\norm{(x,y)}\ne{0}$ for all
                    $(x,y)\in{X}$. Moreover, both $f$ and $g$ are continuous.
                    Define $H:X\times{I}\rightarrow{X}$ by:
                    \begin{equation}
                        H\big((x,y),t\big)
                        =(1-t)\cdot{f}(x,y)+t\cdot\identity{X}(x,y)
                    \end{equation}
                    $H$ is well defined since if $(x,y)\in{X}$, $t\in[0,1]$,
                    then by the triangle inequality:
                    \begin{subequations}
                        \begin{align}
                            \norm{H\big((x,y),t\big)}
                            &\geq\min\{\,\norm{\identity{X}(x,y)},\,
                                \norm{f(x,y)}\,\}\\
                            &=\min\{\,\norm{(x,y)},\,1\,\}
                            >0
                        \end{align}
                    \end{subequations}
                    That is, the image of $H$ lies in
                    $\nspace[2]\setminus\{(0,0)\}$. But then
                    $H\big((x,y),0\big)=f(x,y)$, and
                    $H\big((x,y),1\big)=\identity{X}(x,y)$. Moreover, $H$ is
                    continuous and is therefore a homotopy between ${g}\circ{f}$
                    and $\identity{X}$. But also $({f}\circ{g})(x,y)=(x,y)$ for
                    all $(x,y)\in\nsphere[1]$. Thus ${f}\circ{g}=\identity{Y}$,
                    and $\identity{Y}$ is homotopic to itself. Hence, $X$ and
                    $Y$ are homotopy equivalent. But $X$ is unbounded, and is
                    therefore not compact, and $Y$ is closed and bounded, and is
                    thus compact by the Heine-Borel theorem. But homeomorphisms
                    preserve compactness. Hence $X$ and $Y$ are not
                    homeomorphic.
                \end{proof}

                Ahah, you might say, you're exploiting compactness. What if we
                add this condition? The answer is still no, as the following
                demonstrates.
                \begin{theorem}
                    There exists compact connected topological spaces of the
                    same cardinality that are homotopy equivalent but not
                    homeomorphic.
                \end{theorem}
                \begin{proof}
                    Let $X=[\minus{1},1]$, $Y=[\minus{1},1]\times[\minus{1},1]$
                    have their usual subspace topologies from $\mathbb{R}$ and
                    $\nspace[2]$, respectively, and define $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$
                    and $g:Y\rightarrow{X}$ by:
                    \twocolumneq{f(x)=(x,0)}{g(x,y)=x}
                    That is, $f$ is the inclusion mapping and $g$ is the
                    projection in the $y$ axis. Then $g\circ{f}=\identity{X}$.
                    But $H\big((x,y),t\big)=(1-t)(x,0)+t(x,y)$ is a homotopy
                    between $f\circ{g}$ and $\identity{Y}$, and thus
                    $f\circ{g}$ is homotopic to $\identity{Y}$. Therefore $X$
                    and $Y$ are homotopy equivalent. Moreover, they are both
                    compact, (path) connected, and have the cardinality
                    of the continuum. Suppose $h:X\rightarrow{Y}$ is a
                    homeomorphism and let $h(0)=\vector{y}\in{Y}$. If $h$
                    is a homeomorphism between $X$ and $Y$, then the restriction
                    of $h$ to $X\setminus\{0\}$ is a homeomorphism between
                    $[-1,0)\cup(0,1]$ and $[-1,1]^{2}\setminus\{\vector{y}\}$.
                    But $[-1,1]^{2}\setminus\{\vector{y}\}$ is connected and
                    $[-1,0)\cup(0,1]$ is not. But homeomorphisms preserve
                    connectedness. Therefore, $X$ and $Y$ are not homeomorphic.
                \end{proof}
                Now one might point out that these two spaces have different
                dimensions. If we require our spaces to be manifolds of the
                same dimension, is it still possible to be homotopy equivalent
                but not homeomorphic? The answer is yes, and to prove this we
                must first know that a sphere and a torus are \textit{not}
                homeomorphic. This is obvious at first glance, a torus has a
                hole whereas a sphere does not. To prove this rigorously we
                must recall the Jordan curve theorem. Any continuous injective
                closed curve $\gamma:\nsphere[1]\rightarrow\nsphere[2]$ cuts the
                sphere into two parts. Hence if we look at the space
                $\nsphere[2]\setminus\gamma[\nsphere[1]]$ we are left with a
                disconnected space. However, we can cut out a circle from the
                torus and still leave the space connected. If we cut out either
                of the defining circles of the torus
                $\ntorus[2]=\nsphere[1]\times\nsphere[1]$ we are left with
                something homeomorphic to a cylinder, which is connected.
                \par\hfill\par
                This is not entirely useful since the torus is \textit{not}
                homotopy equivalent to the sphere. To make them equivalent we
                puncture the torus in one spot and put three holes into the
                sphere. The resulting spaces are still not homeomorphic, but
                are they homotopy equivalent? The answer is yes.
                \par\hfill\par
                \begin{minipage}[t]{0.52\textwidth}
                    First we prove the sphere with a hole is homeomorphic to the
                    plane $\nspace[2]$, and then we conclude by showing
                    $\nball[2]$ and $\nspace[2]$ are also homeomorphic. The
                    first problem can be solved using the
                    \textit{stereographic projection} depicted in
                    Fig.~\ref{fig:stereographic_projection}. The construction
                    goes as follows: Given a point
                    $\vector{s}=(x,y,z)\in\nsphere[2]\setminus\{(0,0,1)\}$ we
                    draw the straight line between the north pole and
                    $\vector{s}$ and mark where this intersects the $xy$ plane.
                    This unambiguously defines a mapping
                    $\nsphere[2]\setminus\{(0,0,1)\}\rightarrow\nspace[2]$. To
                    conclude we must show it is bijective, continuous, and has
                    a continuous inverse.

                    \begin{subequations}
                        \begin{align}
                            \norm{(x,y,z)}

                                    }{%
                                        (\norm{(X,Y)}+1)^{2}%
                                    }
                                }\\[2ex]
                                &=\sqrt{%

                                    (\norm{(X,Y)}+1)^{2}%

                            }\\[2ex]
                            &=\sqrt{%
                                \frac{%
                                    \norm{(X,Y)}^{4}+2\norm{(X,Y)}^{2}+1%
                                }{%
                                    (\norm{(X,Y)}^{2}+1)^{2}%
                                }%
                            }\\[2ex]
                            &=\sqrt{%
                                \frac{(\norm{(X,Y)}^{2}+1)^{2}}

                            }
                        \end{align}
                    \end{subequations}
                    and hence the norm of $(x,y,z)$ is 1. But also
                    $f(x,y,z)=(X,Y)$ since:
                    \begin{subequations}
                        \begin{align}
                            \Big(\frac{x}{1-z},\frac{y}{1-z}\Big)
                                &=\frac{1}{1-z}\Big(%
                                    \frac{2X}{\norm{(X,Y)}^{2}+1},\,
                                    \frac{2Y}{\norm{(X,Y)}^{2}+1}%
                                \Big)\\[2ex]
                            &=\frac{\norm{(X,Y)}^{2}+1}{2}
                                \Big(%
                                    \frac{2X}{\norm{(X,Y)}^{2}+1},\,
                                    \frac{2Y}{\norm{(X,Y)}^{2}+1}%
                                \Big)\\[2ex]
                            &=(X,Y)\vphantom{\Big(\frac{X}{Y})}
                        \end{align}
                    \end{subequations}
                    and therefore $f$ is surjective. But it is also injective
                    for suppose there are points
                    $(x_{1},y_{1},z_{1}),(x_{2},x_{2},z_{2})\in%
                    \nsphere[2]\setminus\{(0,0,1)\}$ with
                    $f(x_{1},y_{1},z_{1})=f(x_{2},y_{2},z_{2})$. Since
                    $(x_{1},y_{1},z_{1})\in\nsphere[2]\setminus\{(0,0,1)\}$ we
                    have $x_{1}^{2}+y_{1}^{2}=1-z_{1}^{2}$. But then:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \norm{(X,Y)}^{2}=\frac{x_{1}^2+y_{1}^2}{(1-z_{1})^{2}}
                            =\frac{1-z_{1}^{2}}{(1-z_{1})^{2}}
                            =\frac{x_{2}^{2}+y_{2}^{2}}{(1-z_{2})^{2}}
                            =\frac{1-z_{2}^{2}}{(1-z_{2})^{2}}
                    \end{equation}
                    So we have:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \frac{1-z_{1}^{2}}{(1-z_{1})^{2}}
                        =\frac{1-z_{2}^{2}}{(1-z_{2})^{2}}
                    \end{equation}
                    and this further implies:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \frac{1+z_{1}}{1-z_{1}}=\frac{1+z_{2}}{1-z_{2}}
                    \end{equation}
                    But the function $g(x)=\frac{1+x}{1-x}$ is injective and
                    therefore $z_{1}=z_{2}$. From this $x_{1}=x_{2}$ and
                    $y_{1}=y_{2}$. Thus, $f$ is a bijection. Moreoever, $f$ is
                    continuous and:
                    \begin{equation}
                        f^{\minus{1}}(X,Y)=\Big(%
                            \frac{2X}{\norm{(X,Y)}^{2}+1},\,
                            \frac{2Y}{\norm{(X,Y)}^{2}+1},\,
                            \frac{\norm{(X,Y)}^{2}-1}{\norm{(X,Y)}^{2}+1}%
                        \Big)
                    \end{equation}
                    which is continuous. Therefore, $f$ is a homeomorphism.
                \end{proof}
                \begin{theorem}
                    $\nsphere[2]$ is homeomorphic to $\nball[2]$.
                \end{theorem}
                \begin{proof}
                    Define $f:\nball[2]\rightarrow\nspace[2]$ by:
                    \begin{equation}
                        f(\vector{x})=\frac{\vector{x}}{1-\norm{\vector{x}}}
                    \end{equation}
                    Then $f$ is surjective. For if $\vector{y}\in\nspace[2]$,
                    let $\vector{x}=\frac{\vector{y}}{1+\norm{\vector{y}}}$.
                    Then:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \norm{\vector{x}}
                        =\frac{\norm{\vector{y}}}{1+\norm{\vector{y}}}<1
                    \end{equation}
                    and thus $\vector{x}\in\nball[2]$. Evaluating with $f$ we
                    obtain:
                    \begin{subequations}
                        \begin{align}
                            f(\vector{x})
                            &=\frac{\vector{y}}{1+\norm{\vector{y}}}\Big(%
                                1-\frac{\norm{\vector{y}}}{1+\norm{\vector{y}}}
                            \Big)^{\minus{1}}\\[1ex]
                            &=\frac{\vector{y}}{1+\norm{\vector{y}}}\Big(%
                                \frac{%
                                    1+\norm{\vector{y}}-
                                    \norm{\vector{y}}%
                                }{%
                                    1+\norm{\vector{y}}%
                                }
                            \Big)^{\minus{1}}\\[1ex]
                            &=\frac{\vector{y}}{1+\norm{\vector{y}}}\Big(%
                                \frac{1}{1+\norm{\vector{y}}}
                            \Big)^{\minus{1}}\\[1ex]
                            &=\vector{y}\vphantom{\Big(\frac{X}{Y}\Big)}
                        \end{align}
                    \end{subequations}
                    Moreover, $f$ is injective. For if
                    $f(\vector{x}_{1})=f(\vector{x}_{2})$, then:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \frac{\norm{\vector{x}_{1}}}{1+\norm{\vector{x}_{1}}}
                        =\norm{f(\vector{x}_{1})}
                        =\norm{f(\vector{x}_{2})}
                        =\frac{\norm{\vector{x}_{2}}}{1+\norm{\vector{x}}_{2}}
                    \end{equation}
                    and therefore
                    $\norm{\vector{x}}_{1}=\norm{\vector{x}_{2}}$.
                    But from the definition of $f$:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \frac{\vector{x}_{1}}{1+\norm{\vector{x}_{1}}}
                        =\frac{\vector{x}_{2}}{1+\norm{\vector{x}_{2}}}
                    \end{equation}
                    and therefore $\vector{x}_{1}=\vector{x}_{2}$. Lastly,
                    $f$ is continuous and:
                    \begin{equation}
                        f^{\minus{1}}(\vector{y})
                        =\frac{\vector{y}}{1+\norm{\vector{y}}}                    
                    \end{equation}
                    which is continuous. Therefore, $f$ is a homeomorphism.
                \end{proof}
                \begin{theorem}
                    $\nsphere[2]\setminus\{(0,0,1)\}$ is homeomorphic to
                    $\nball[2]$.
                \end{theorem}
                \begin{proof}
                    For $\nsphere[2]\setminus\{(0,0,1)\}$ is homeomorphic to
                    $\nspace[2]$, and $\nspace[2]$ is homeomorphic to
                    $\nball[2]$, and homeomorphic is transitive.
                \end{proof}
                It's easier to visual this homeomorphism in one step. This is
                shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:homeo_Punc_S2_and_Plane}.
                \begin{figure}[H]

                We continue our endeavor of finding topological manifolds of the
                same dimension that are homotopy equivalent but not homeomorphic
                by defining Jordan curves. These are continuous injective
                functions
                $f:\nsphere[1]\rightarrow\nspace[2]$. With this we now state,
                but do not prove, the Jordan Curve Theorem.
                \begin{ftheorem}{Jordan Curve Theorem}{Jordan_Curve_Theorem}
                    If $\Gamma$ is a Jordan Curve, then there exists two unique
                    disjoint open connected sets $\interior[]{\Gamma}$ and
                    $\exterior[]{\Gamma}$, called the interior and exterior of
                    $\Gamma$, such that:
                    \begin{equation*}
                        \nspace[2]\setminus\Gamma
                            =\interior[]{\Gamma}\cup\exterior[]{\Gamma}
                    \end{equation*}
                    And such that $\partial\interior[]{\Gamma}=\Gamma$ and
                    $\partial\exterior[]{\Gamma}=\Gamma$. $\interior[](\Gamma)$
                    is bounded and $\exterior[]{\Gamma}$ is unbounded.
                \end{ftheorem}
                The Jordan Curve Theorem implies that the injective continuous
                image of $\nsphere[1]$ into the $\nsphere[2]$ will cut the
                sphere into two parts.
                \begin{theorem}
                    \label{thm:Sphere_Without_Circle_Is_Disconnected}
                    If $f:\nsphere[1]\rightarrow\nsphere[2]$ is a continuous
                    injective function, then there exists two disjoint open
                    connected sets $\mathcal{U}_{1}$ and $\mathcal{U}_{2}$ with
                    $\nsphere[2]\setminus{f}[\nsphere[1]]%
                    =\mathcal{U}_{1}\cup\mathcal{U}_{2}$
                \end{theorem}
                \begin{proof}
                    First note that $f$ is not surjective. Since $\nsphere[1]$
                    is compact, any bijection
                    $f:\nsphere[1]\rightarrow\nsphere[2]$ would be a
                    homeomorphism but $\nsphere[1]$ and $\nsphere[2]$ are not
                    homeomorphic. Removing two points from $\nsphere[1]$
                    disconnects it, but removing two points from $\nsphere[2]$
                    leaves the sphere in one piece. Hence there is a point
                    $\vector{s}\in\nsphere[2]$ that $f$ does not map too.
                    Moreover, since the image of $\nsphere[1]$ must be closed
                    since $\nsphere[1]$ is compact, there is an open ball around
                    $\vector{s}$ such that $f$ does not map into this set. Hence
                    we may remove this point without affecting the image of $f$.
                    But $\nsphere[2]\setminus\{\vector{s}\}$ is homeomorphic to
                    $\nspace[2]$ so there is a homeomorphism
                    $g:\nsphere[2]\setminus\{\vector{s}\}\rightarrow\nspace[2]$.
                    But then $\Gamma=g\circ{f}$ is a Jordan Curve. By the Jordan
                    Curve Theorem there exist disjoint open connected sets
                    $\interior[]{\Gamma}$ and $\exterior[]{\Gamma}$ with
                    $\interior[]{\Gamma}\cup\exterior[]{\Gamma}%
                    =\nspace[2]\setminus\Gamma$. Define
                    $\mathcal{U}_{1}=g^{\minus{1}}\big[\interior[]{\Gamma}\big]$
                    and $\mathcal{U}_{2}=g^{\minus{1}}%
                    \big[\exterior[]{\Gamma}\big]\cup\{\vector{s}\}$.
                    Then $\mathcal{U}_{1}$ and $\mathcal{U}_{2}$ are open,
                    disjoint, connected, and cover
                    $\nsphere[2]\setminus{f}[\nsphere[1]]$.
                \end{proof}
                We can now prove that the sphere and the torus are not
                homeomorphic.
                \begin{ltheorem}{$\nsphere[2]$ is not Homeomorphic to $\ntorus[]$}
                                {Sphere_Not_Homeo_to_Torus}
                    There is no homeomorphism between the sphere $\nsphere[2]$
                    and the torus $\ntorus[]$.
                \end{ltheorem}
                \begin{proof}
                    The Torus is the Cartesian product of two circles,
                    $\ntorus[]=\nsphere[1]\times\nsphere[1]$, and by removing
                    the inner circle we are left with a connected set. Suppose
                    the two are homeomorphic and let
                    $f:\ntorus[]\rightarrow\nsphere[2]$ be a homeomorphism. Then
                    the restriction of $f$ to $\ntorus[]\setminus\nsphere[1]$ is
                    a homeomorphism with $\nsphere[2]\setminus{f}[\nsphere[1]]$.
                    But by Thm.~\ref{thm:Sphere_Without_Circle_Is_Disconnected}
                    $\nsphere[2]\setminus{f}[\nsphere[1]]$ is disconnected, a
                    contradiction.
                \end{proof}
                It should be intuitively clear that both the torus and the
                sphere are two dimensional topological manifolds. If we remove a
                finite number of points from either of these we are still left
                with two dimensional manifolds.
                \begin{theorem}
                    There exist topological manifolds $\topspace[X]{X}$ and
                    $\topspace[Y]{Y}$ of the same dimension that are homotopy
                    equivalent but not homeomorphic.
                \end{theorem}
                We'll prove this with pictures. We know the sphere with three
                holes is homeomorphic to a plane with 2 holes. But we've seen
                that this is homotopy equivalent to a figure eight since there
                is a deformation retraction of the doubly punctured plane onto
                a lemniscate. Similarly, if we use our square representation of
                a torus we can show that a torus with one hole is homotopy
                equivalent to a figure eight, see
                Fig.~\ref{fig:HE_Torus_Sphere_Fig_8}.

                Now, you say, hold on! You lost compactness! This is precisely
                getting down to Poincar\'{e}'s conjectures. When one classifies
                all two dimensional manifolds, they come across the fact that
                if $\topspace{X}$ is a compact two dimensional topological
                manifold that is homotopy equivalent to $\nsphere[2]$, then it
                is homeomorphic to it. Quite an impressive theorem, but
                Poincar\'{e} asks for the next dimension up:
                \begin{center}
                    \textit{If} $\topspace{X}$ \textit{is a three dimensional}
                    \textit{compact manifold that is homotopy equivalent to}
                    $\nsphere[3]$, \textit{is it homeomorphic?}
                \end{center}
                The answer is yes, but the proof is \textit{hard}.
                \par\hfill\par
                Now, while we've called homotopy equivalence an
                \textit{equivalence}, it would be nice to know that it actually
                is. We prove this now.
                \begin{ltheorem}{Reflexivity of Homotopy Equivalence}
                                {Reflexivity_of_Homotopy_Equivalence}
                    If $\topspace{X}$ is a topological space, then it is
                    homotopy equivalent to itself.
                \end{ltheorem}
                \begin{proof}
                    For any topological space is homeomorphic to itself, and
                    homeomorphic topological spaces are homotopy equivalent.
                \end{proof}

                                {Symmetry_of_Homotopy_Equivalence}
                    If $\topspace[X]{X}$ and $\topspace[Y]{Y}$ are topological
                    spaces, and if $X$ is homotopy equivalent to $Y$, then
                    $Y$ is homotopy equivalent to $X$.
                \end{ltheorem}
                \begin{proof}
                    For if $X$ is homotopy equivalent to $Y$, then there is a
                    homotopy equivalence $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$. But if $f$ is a
                    homotopy equivalence, then there is a homotopy inverse
                    $g:Y\rightarrow{X}$. But if $g$ is a homotopy inverse of
                    $f$, then $f\circ{g}$ is homotopic to $\identity{Y}$ and
                    $g\circ{f}$ is homotopic to $\identity{X}$. But then $f$ is
                    a homotopy inverse of $g$, and hence $g$ is a homotopy
                    equivalence. Therefore, $Y$ is homotopic to $X$.
                \end{proof}
                \begin{ltheorem}{Transitivity of Homotopy Equivalence}
                                {Transitivity_of_Homotopy_Equivalence}
                    If $\topspace[X]{X}$, $\topspace[Y]{Y}$, and
                    $\topspace[Z]{Z}$ are topological spaces, if $X$ is homotopy
                    equivalent to $Y$, and if $Y$ is homotopy equivalent to $Z$,
                    then $X$ is homotopy equivalent to $Z$.
                \end{ltheorem}
                \begin{proof}
                    For if $X$ is homotopy equivalent to $Y$, then there is a
                    homotopy equivalence $f_{1}:X\rightarrow{Y}$. But if $f_{1}$
                    is a homotopy equivalence, then there is a homotopy inverse
                    $g_{1}:Y\rightarrow{X}$. But if $Y$ is homotopy equivalent
                    to $Z$, then there is a homotopy equivalence
                    $f_{2}:Y\rightarrow{Z}$. And if $f_{2}$ is a homotopy
                    equivalence, then there is a homotopy inverse
                    $g_{2}:Y\rightarrow{Z}$. But then
                    $f_{2}\circ{f}_{1}:X\rightarrow{Z}$ is a homotopy
                    equivalence since $g_{1}\circ{g}_{2}:Z\rightarrow{X}$ is a
                    homotopy inverse. That is,
                    $f_{2}\circ{f}_{1}\circ{g}_{1}\circ{g}_{2}$ is homotopic to
                    $f_{2}\circ{g}_{2}$ since $f_{1}\circ{g}_{1}$ is homotopic
                    to $\identity{Y}$. But $f_{2}\circ{g}_{2}$ is homotopic to
                    $\identity{Z}$, and homotopic is transitive
                    (Thm.~\ref{thm:Transitivity_of_Homotopy}). Similarly,
                    $g_{1}\circ{g}_{2}\circ{f}_{2}\circ{f}_{1}$ is homotopic to
                    $\identity{X}$. Hence, $X$ is homotopic to $Z$.
                \end{proof}
                Before moving on to cell complexes, we should finally discuss
                some of the subtleties of contractible spaces. First, there's an
                equivalent definition based purely on the existence of certain
                types of homotopies.
                \begin{fdefinition}{Nullhomotopic}{Nullhomotopic}
                    A nullhomotopic function from a topological
                    $\topspace[X]{X}$ to $\topspace[Y]{Y}$ is a continuous
                    function $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ such that there exists a
                    homotopy $H:X\times{I}\rightarrow{Y}$ between $f$ and a
                    constant mapping $g:X\rightarrow{Y}$.
                \end{fdefinition}
                \begin{theorem}
                    If $\topspace{X}$ is a topological space, then it is
                    contractible if and only if $\identity{X}$ is nullhomotopic.
                \end{theorem}
                \begin{proof}
                    If $\topspace{X}$ is contractible, then there is a homotopy
                    equivalence $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ where $Y=\{0\}$ is the
                    one point space. But if $f$ is a homotopy equivalence, then
                    there is a homotopy inverse $g:Y\rightarrow{X}$. But then
                    $g\circ{f}$ is homotopic to $\identity{X}$. But $Y$ has only
                    one point, and hence $f(x)=0$ for all $x\in{X}$. Let
                    $x_{0}=g(0)$. Then $g\circ{f}:X\rightarrow{X}$ is the
                    mapping $x\mapsto{x}_{0}$. But $\identity{X}$ is homotopic
                    to this, and is therefore nullhomotopic. In the other
                    direction, if $\identity{X}$ is nullhomotopic, then there is
                    a point $x_{0}\in{X}$ such that $\identity{X}$ is homotopic
                    to the function $f:X\rightarrow{X}$ defined by $f(x)=x_{0}$.
                    Let $Y=\{x_{0}\}$ be given the subspace topology. Since
                    there is only one topology on a space with one point, this
                    is homeomorphic to the one point space. But then $f$ is a
                    homotopy equivalence since the function $g:Y\rightarrow{X}$
                    given by $g(x_{0})=x_{0}$ is a homotopy inverse of $f$. That
                    is, since $\identity{X}$ is homotopic to $f$,
                    $g\circ{f}$ is homotopic to $\identity{X}$ since
                    $g\circ{f}=f$. But also $f\circ{g}=\identity{Y}$. Hence $f$
                    is an homotopy equivalence and $\topspace{X}$ is
                    contractible.
                \end{proof}
                \begin{theorem}
                    If $n\in\mathbb{N}$, and if $\tau_{\nspace}$ is the standard
                    topology on $\nspace$, then $\topspace[\nspace]{\nspace}$ is
                    contractible.
                \end{theorem}
                \begin{proof}
                    For let $f:\nspace\rightarrow\nspace$ be the zero mapping,
                    $f(\vector{x})=\vector{0}$. But any continuous function
                    $g:\nspace\rightarrow\nspace$ is homotopic to $f$, and hence
                    $\identity{\nspace}$ is homotopic to $f$. Hence, the
                    identity map is nullhomotopic and therefore $\nspace$ is
                    contractible.
                \end{proof}
                \begin{theorem}
                    If $\topspace{X}$ is a contractible topological space, then
                    it is path connected.
                \end{theorem}
                \begin{proof}
                    For if $X$ is contractible, then $\identity{X}$ is homotopic
                    to a constant map. Let $g:X\rightarrow{X}$ defined by
                    $g(x)=c$ be such a constant mapping, $H$ the homotopy, and
                    let $x_{1},x_{2}\in{X}$. Then $H(x_{1},t)$ is a path between
                    $x_{1}$ and $c$, and $H(x_{2},t)$ is a path between
                    $c$ and $x_{2}$. By concatenation there is a path between
                    $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$. Hence, $X$ is path connected.
                \end{proof}
                Contractible and deformation retractions to a point aren't quite
                identical notions. There are spaces with \textit{weak}
                deformation retracts to a single point but no \textit{strong}
                deformation retracts. The concept of contractible doesn't care
                how the contraction is done. That is, the point being contracted
                to may move during the homotopy. This does give us the following
                theorem.
                \begin{theorem}
                    If $\topspace{X}$ is a topological space, then $X$ is
                    contractible if and only if there is a (weak) deformation
                    retraction of $X$ to a point.
                \end{theorem}
                \begin{proof}
                    For $X$ is contractible if and only if $\identity{X}$ is
                    nullhomotopic. Let $H$ be the homotopy. Then $H$ is a
                    weak deformation retraction of $X$ to a single point.
                    Similarly, if such a weak deformation retraction exists,
                    then $\identity{X}$ is nullhomotopic.
                \end{proof}
                We have shown that any pair of functions into a topological
                vector space are homotopic, and we used the straight line
                homotopy. This generalizes to all contractible spaces.
                \begin{theorem}
                    If $\topspace[Y]{Y}$ is a contractible topological space, if
                    $\topspace[X]{X}$ is a topological space, and if
                    $f,g:X\rightarrow{Y}$ are continuous functions, then they
                    are homotopic.
                \end{theorem}
                \begin{proof}
                    For if $Y$ is contractible, then there is a homotopy $H$
                    between $\identity{Y}$ and a constant map. But then
                    $G:X\times{I}\rightarrow{Y}$ defined by
                    $G(x,t)=H(f(x),t)$ is a homotopy between $f(x)$ and the
                    constant point $c\in{Y}$. Hence, $f$ is homotopic to the
                    constant map $h(x)=c$. Similarly, $g$ is homotopic to $h$.
                    But homotopic is transitive, and hence $f$ is homotopic to
                    $g$.
                \end{proof}
                \begin{theorem}
                    If $\topvecspace{X}$ is a topological vector space over a
                    path connected subfield $\mathbb{F}\subseteq\mathbb{C}$,
                    then $\topspace{X}$ is contractible.
                \end{theorem}
                \begin{proof}
                    Since $\mathbb{F}$ is a field, 0 and 1 are elements of
                    $\mathbb{F}$. Moreover, $n\in\mathbb{F}$ for all
                    $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and from this we conclude that
                    $\mathbb{Q}\cap[0,1]\subseteq\mathbb{F}$. But $\mathbb{F}$
                    is path connected, and hence $[0,1]\subseteq\mathbb{F}$. Now
                    let $H:X\times{I}\rightarrow{X}$ be defined by:
                    \begin{equation}
                        H(\vector{x},t)=t\cdot\vector{x}
                    \end{equation}
                    By the previous argument this is well defined for all
                    $t\in[0,1]$. Moreover, since $X$ is a topological vector
                    space this is continuous. But
                    $H(\vector{x},0)=\identity{X}(\vector{x})$ and
                    $H(\vector{x},1)=\vector{0}$. Hence $H$ is a homotopy
                    between the identity map and the constant map
                    $\vector{x}\mapsto\vector{0}$ so the identity map is
                    nullhomotopic. But a topological space is contractible if and
                    only if the identity map is nullhomotopic.
                \end{proof}
                Many spaces that appear to be non-contractible can actually be
                contracted. The converse usually isn't true, if a space looks
                contractible it \textit{probably} is. An example of a space that
                doesn't look contractible, but is, is the \textit{dunce cap}. We
                use the method of gluing the sides of a polygon together the
                same way we did with the torus and M\"{o}bius strip, but instead
                perform this operation on a triangle
                (Fig.~\ref{fig:Dunce_Cap_001}).

                \end{figure}
                After gluing the final two circles together, we have a beanie
                hat that has been wrapped on itself. The portion of the hat
                where the head goes is still intact and we may pull the cap back
                and around to the gluing point shown at the far right of
                Fig.~\ref{fig:Dunce_Cap_001}. The result shows this space is
                contractible. Later with the help of van Kampen's theorem we
                will make this rigorous. For now we note the dunce cap may embed
                as a compact retract of $\nspace[3]$. We construct the embedding
                by noting that the third step in Fig.~\ref{fig:Dunce_Cap_001} is
                just a cone, which is homeomorphic to $\ndisk[2]$. We could use
                the following map via cylindrical coordinates:
                $(r,\theta)\mapsto(r,\theta,r)$, but instead we will use a
                bizarre representation which will allow us to easily obtain the
                dunce cap. We start with the unit circle in the $xy$ plane. We
                then slowly lift this circle, gyrating its center and shrinking
                the radius. We do this in such a manner that the shadow always
                has a single point on our starting circle in the $xy$ plane. We
                can given an explicit parameterization mapping $[0,1]^{2}$ onto
                this surface as follows. Define the functions
                $x_{0}(y)=y\cos(2\pi{y})$,
                $y_{0}(y)=y\sin(2\pi{y})$, and $r(y)=1-y$. Using this, we write:
                \begin{equation}
                    \label{eqn:Func_for_Twisted_Cone}
                    f(x,y)=\big(
                        r(y)\cos(2\pi{x})+x_{0}(y),\,
                        r(y)\sin(2\pi{x})+y_{0}(y),\,
                        y
                    \big)
                \end{equation}
                \par
                \begin{minipage}[b]{0.54\textwidth}
                    The resulting surface is shown in
                    Fig.~\ref{fig:Twisted_Cone}. The arrows in
                    Fig.~\ref{fig:Dunce_Cap_001} correspond to the thick black
                    lines (the spiral part and the bottom circle) which
                    correspond to functions $g,h:I\rightarrow\nspace[3]$ defined
                    by $g(t)=f(t,t)$ and $h(t)=f(t,0)$, respectively. Now we see
                    why we've chosen this representation. To obtain the dunce
                    cap we need only collapse the edge of the spiral down to the
                    bottom circle. Moreover we can achieve this with zero
                    self-intersections.

                To accomplish the task we must collapse the spiral downwards as
                the radius approaches 1. Great care must be made in choosing
                this map since simple projections will have an abundance of
                intersections. We choose the following since it makes the
                visualizing easier:
                \begin{equation}
                    f(x,y)=\big(
                        r(y)\cos(2\pi{x})+x_{0}(y),\,

                        y^{2}(1-R^{2})
                    \big)
                \end{equation}
                where $x_{0}$ $y_{0}$ are the functions defined in
                Eqn.~\ref{eqn:Func_for_Twisted_Cone}, and $R$ is the Euclidean
                norm of the $x$ and $y$ components of $f$. The image of this
                function in $\nspace[3]$ is shown in
                Fig.~\ref{fig:Dunce_Cap_003}.

                As claimed, the place where the head goes is left untouched and
                we may pull the cap along longitudinal lines, converging to a
                single point. It is easier to see this if we look beneath the
                cap (Fig.~\ref{fig:Dunce_Cap_004}).

                    A rigorous proof can be given if we can show the dunce cap
                    is a retract of $\nball[3]$ and that the retract of a
                    contractible space is still contractible. Using either
                    Fig.~\ref{fig:Dunce_Cap_003} or Fig.~\ref{fig:Dunce_Cap_004}
                    we can obtain intuition as to why the cap is a retract of
                    the 3-ball. Starting with a ball of clay we can push the
                    bottom of the clay inwards creating a space for the head and
                    then smoothly press into the top, deforming it
                    continuously until we obtain our hat. If we perform this
                    operation carefully the dunce cap never needed to move
                    which shows we have a strong deformation retraction of
                    $\nball[3]$ to our strange space.
                \end{minipage}
                \par\vspace{2.5ex}
                To conclude we need only know that retracts of contractible
                remain contractible
                (Thm.~\ref{thm:Retract_of_Contractible_is_Contractible}). For
                now we present another example, Bing's
                \textit{house with two rooms}, named after
                the American mathematician R. H. Bing.
                \par\hfill\par
                The house has two rooms, an upstairs and a downstairs. To get to
                the basement you need to climb onto the roof and drop down the
                tunnel on the left. Similarly, to get to the attic one would
                need to dig underneath the house and climb through the tunnel on
                the right. In addition, each tunnel has a wall connecting it to
                the exterior. The result is shown in
                Fig.~\ref{fig:House_with_Two_Rooms_001}. It's hard to see why
                this is contractible, but what's even stranger is that a
                thickened house with two rooms (a house made with actual wood
                that has thickness) is \textit{homeomorphic} to the 3-ball
                $\nball[3]$. That is homeomorphic, not just homotopy equivalent,
                a much stronger notion. If one could show this then the house
                with two rooms is just a retract of a contractible space. We
                conclude by invoking the yet-to-be-proved
                Thm.~\ref{thm:Retract_of_Contractible_is_Contractible}. Let's
                show that the thickened house is homeomorphic to $\nball[3]$. To
                do this we'll first create something that is homotopy equivalent
                to the house by taking the supports of the tunnels and squeezing
                them to the wall. We then push the tunnels into the corners.
                What remains is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:House_with_Two_Rooms_002}
                (the front wall being removed for the sake of visualization).
                \begin{figure}

                    \captionsetup{type=figure}

                \end{figure}
                \par\hfill\par
                We take a thickened version of this and show it is homeomorphic
                to $\nball[3]$. The 3-ball is homeomorphic to a fat cube
                $(0,1)^{3}$. Again imagining it's made of clay, we push
                into the top corner and then outwards as we start to hollow out
                the bottom, creating our basement. We do the same procedure with
                the other tunnel, hollowing out the top to create our attic.
                This homotopy is actually a family of homeomorphisms since we
                are not collapsing or squeezing together any parts. The process
                is continuous and has a continuous inverse, and hence the end
                result is homeomorphic to what we started with. This shows the
                thickened house with two rooms is homeomorphic to $\nball[3]$.
                We finish our demonstration that Bing's house is contractible
                with Thm.~\ref{thm:Retract_of_Contractible_is_Contractible}.

                    \label{thm:Retract_of_Contractible_is_Contractible}%
                    If $\topspace{X}$ is a contractible topological space, and
                    if there is a retract $f:X\rightarrow{A}$ onto a subset
                    $A\subseteq{X}$, then $A$ is contractible.
                \end{theorem}
                \begin{proof}
                    For $\topspace{X}$ is contractible if and only if
                    $\identity{X}$ is nullhomotopic. That is, there is a point
                    $x_{0}\in{X}$ such that $\identity{X}$ is homotopic to the
                    function $g:X\rightarrow{X}$ defined by $g(x)=x_{0}$. But if
                    $f:X\rightarrow{A}$ is a retract, then
                    $f|_{A}=\identity{A}$. Hence $f\circ{H}|_{A\times{I}}$ is a
                    homotopy between $\identity{A}$ and $f(x_{0})$. Therefore,
                    $A$ is contractible.

        \section{Cell Complexes}
            Topological manifolds are spaces that look locally like some
            $\nspace$. Neither our our sphere with string attached to the poles
            nor our kettle bell (Figs.~\ref{fig:Sphere_with_String_Attached} and
            \ref{fig:Kettle_Bell}, respectively) can be considered topological
            manifolds since there are these strange points where the space
            locally looks like $\nspace[2]$ plus a pike. It is perhaps
            worthwhile to attempt to generalize manifolds to spaces that have
            various regions that are of different dimension. The approach that
            is best for homotopy theory was developed by the British
            mathematician J. H. C. Whitehead (1904-1960 C.E.) and is called a
            CW complex. It is very combinatorial and computable, but has one
            subtle problem: it is not known if every manifold is homeomorphic to
            a CW complex. Indeed, in dimension 4 it's not even known in the
            compact case (the result is true for compact manifolds of high
            enough dimension, and in all dimensions for compact smooth
            manifolds). It is perhaps a poor use of language to call this
            a generalization, but there is a saving grace: Every manifold is
            homotopy equivalent to a CW complex. So it is in the setting of
            homotopy theory where this new concept works best. Without further
            adieu, we describe the construction.
            \par\hfill\par
            We start with a collection of points, a discrete space $X^{0}$. The
            elements are called the 0-cells. We inductively define the $n$
            skeleton $X^{n}$ from $X^{n-1}$ by attaching open balls $\nball$,
            called $n$ cells, via \textit{attaching} maps
            $\varphi:\nsphere[n-1]\rightarrow{X}^{n-1}$. That is, we attached
            the boundary of $\nball$ (which is $\nsphere[n-1]$) to $X^{n-1}$.
            We topologize this in same way one does an \textit{adjunction} space
            in point-set topology. We look at the disjoint union
            $X^{n-1}\coprod_{\alpha}\closure[]{\nball}_{\alpha}$ and give this
            the quotient topology by gluing elements of the boundary
            $x\in\partial\closure[]{\nball}_{\alpha}$ with
            $\varphi_{\alpha}(x)$.
            \par\hfill\par
            Some explaination of notation. $\nball$ is the \textit{open} unit
            ball in $\nspace$, and $\closure[]{A}$ denotes the closure of a
            subset $A\subseteq\nspace$ with respect to the usual topology.
            Hence, $\closure[]{\nball}$ is simply the \textit{closed} ball.
            $\partial{A}$ represents the topological \textit{boundary} of
            $X$. If $\topspace{X}$ is a topological space and
            $A\subseteq{X}$, the boundary of $A$ is:
            \begin{equation}
                \partial{A}=\closure{A}\setminus\interior{A}
            \end{equation}
            where $\closure{A}$ and $\interior{A}$ denote the closures and
            interiors of $A$ with respect to the topology $\tau$. From this,
            $\partial\closure[]{\nball}$ is just the $n-1$ sphere
            $\nsphere[n-1]$.
            \par\hfill\par
            If the process stops after $n\in\mathbb{N}$ steps we may
            topologize this space with the quotient topology. If not then we
            need a way of placing a topology on the set $X=\bigcup_{n}X^{n}$. We
            declare $\mathcal{U}\subseteq{X}$ open if and only if for all
            $n\in\mathbb{N}$ it is true that $\mathcal{U}\cap{X}^{n}$ is an open
            subset of $X^{n}$ with its quotient topology. The dimension of $X$
            is the largest dimension of cells in $X$, if such a maximum exist.
            \begin{example}
                The closed unit interval $I=[0,1]$ is a CW complex by attaching
                the open unit interval $(0,1)$ to the 0-skeleton
                $X^{0}=\{0,1\}$. The open unit interval is homeomorphic to
                $\nball[1]=(\minus{1},1)$ so our construction is valid.
            \end{example}
            \begin{example}
                The torus $\ntorus[]=\nsphere[1]\times\nsphere[1]$ has a nice
                CW structure. We start with a point and attach two 1-cells. The
                result is a figure-eight. From here we attach the square
                $[0,1]\times[0,1]$, which is homeomorphic to
                $\closure[]{\nball[2]}$, along these circles in a manner similar
                to how we glued the square into $\ntorus[]$
                (Fig.~\ref{fig:Square_to_Torus}). The resulting CW complex is
                shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:CW_Complex_Torus}.

                    point for our 0 skeleton $X^{0}$, set $X^{1}=X^{0}$, and
                    then attach the boundary of a single 2-cell to this point.
                    That is, we have one 0-cell, zero 1-cells, and one 2-cell.
                    The result of this construction is shown in
                    Fig.~\ref{fig:Sphere_CW_Complex}. The representation of a
                    topological space by a CW complex is not unique, as the
                    next example shows.

                    One natural means of separating the sphere into smaller
                    parts is by using hemispheres. If we place a single point
                    and then attach the equator, we may then glue the northern
                    and southern hemispheres. The result is a CW complex built
                    from one 0-cell, one 1-cell, and two 2-cells
                    (Fig.~\ref{fig:Sphere_Alt_CW_Complex}). It is homeomorphic
                    to $\nsphere[2]$, but is a different CW complex then

                A two-holed surface, also known as a genus two surface, can be
                realized as a CW complex in a similar manner as the torus. The
                torus can be obtained by identifying parts on a square, whereas
                a genus two surface can be obtained by identifying parts of an
                octagon. An explicit representation is shown in
                Fig.~\ref{fig:Octagon_to_Genus_Two}. This also shows that a

                Similar to how the sphere has more than one representation as a
                CW complex, so does the genus two surface. We can represent it
                by six 0-cells, twelve 1-cells, and four 2-cells
                (Fig.~\ref{fig:Genus_Two_CW_Complex}).
            \end{example}
            These examples are all oriented smooth manifolds. The familiar
            non-oriented manifolds can also be given the structure of a CW
            complex. The real projective plane can be defined by identifying
            all lines through the origin in $\nspace[3]$. We equip
            $\nspace[3]\setminus\{\vector{0}\}$ with the equivalence relation
            $R$ such that $\vector{x}R\vector{y}$ if and only if there exists a
            non-zero $\lambda\in\mathbb{R}$ with $\vector{y}=\lambda\vector{x}$.
            The quotient space $\nspace[3]/R$ is the real projective plane.
            Better yet, if we think of only unit vectors this becomes a quotient
            on $\nsphere[2]$ which identifies all antepodal points, which also
            reveals $\mathbb{RP}^{2}$ is compact. This construction generalizes
            to all $n\in\mathbb{N}$. While these constructions are great for
            computations in the manifold and topological settings, they do not
            give us an obvious means of
            creating a CW complex. This is overcome by considering the
            \textit{fundamental polygon} of $\mathbb{RP}^{2}$. Every compact
            2-dimensional manifold can be obtain as as the quotient of a polygon
            in the plane by identifying the edges in some manner. We've seen
            this with the torus, M\"{o}bius band, and the dunce cap (though the
            dunce cap is \textit{not} a manifold), and a
            similar construction holds for $\mathbb{RP}^{2}$. Like the torus,
            the fundamental polygon for $\mathbb{RP}^{2}$ is a square. The
            quotient is obtained by introducing two twists. Explicitly we
            identify $(x,0)$ with $(1-x,1)$ and $(0,y)$ with $(1,1-y)$, the
            identifications are drawn in
            Fig.~\ref{fig:Square_to_Real_Proj_Plane}.

                \begin{example}
                    We can use the fundamental polygon of $\mathbb{RP}^{2}$ to
                    exhibit a CW structure. The four corners of the square all
                    map to the same point so we have one 0-cell. Similarly the
                    4 edges all glue together giving us one 1-cell. Lastly,
                    since the quotient leaves the interior untouched we have
                    one 2-cell. Hence $\mathbb{RP}^{2}$ consists of one 0-cell,
                    one 1-cell, and one 2-cell. Like the sphere, this CW
                    structure is not unique. We obtain a new one by attaching
                    a diagonal line creating two triangular 2-cells.

            It would be useless to draw the contortions the square
            must undergo in converting from the fundamental polygon into
            the real projective plane, but the process does admit a
            parameterization into $\nspace[3]$ that we may draw.

                The resulting object is called the \textit{cross cap}
                (Fig.~\ref{fig:Cross_Cap}). It must self-intersect since it is
                impossible to embed $\mathbb{RP}^{2}$ into $\nspace[3]$. It
                is difficult to see so a wireframe representation is given in
                Fig.~\ref{fig:Inside_Cross_Cap}. The pinch point present in this

                Before going \textit{up} in dimension, it is worthwhile going
                down and seeing what $\mathbb{RP}^{0}$ and $\mathbb{RP}^{1}$
                look like. The zero dimensional real projective plane is just a
                point. That is, we take $\mathbb{R}\setminus\{0\}$ and give it
                the equivalence relation $xRy$ if and only if there is a
                $\lambda\in\mathbb{R}\setminus\{0\}$ with $y=\lambda{x}$. But
                this is true of every non-zero element since
                $\mathbb{R}\setminus\{0\}$ is a group under multiplication.
                Explicitly, let $\lambda=y/x$. For $n=1$ we can note that there
                are only two connected topological manifolds of dimension 1,
                $\mathbb{R}$ and $\nsphere[1]$, and all of the real projective
                spaces are manifolds. But $\mathbb{RP}^{n}$ is compact, ruling
                out $\mathbb{R}$.
            \end{minipage}

            From this we conclude $\mathbb{RP}^{1}$ is homeomorphic to
            $\nsphere[1]$. All of the interesting stuff finally kicks in with
            $n=2$. Higher dimensional real projective spaces can be realized by
            attaching a closed ball $\closure[]{\nball}$ to $\mathbb{RP}^{n-1}$.
            Hence by induction every real projective space is a CW complex with
            one $k$ cell for all $k=0,1,\dots,n$.
            \begin{example}
                Our first infinite dimensional example is obtained from
                the real projective spaces $\mathbb{RP}^{n}$. We define
                $\mathbb{RP}^{\infty}=\bigcup_{n}\mathbb{RP}^{n}$ and give
                this the topology of an infinite dimensional CW complex with
                $n$ skeleton $X^{n}=\mathbb{RP}^{n}$.
            \end{example}
            \begin{example}
                We can similarly obtain $\nsphere[\infty]$ from
                $\bigcup_{n}\nsphere$ and give this the structure of a CW
                complex. This can be phrased as the space of all finitely
                supported sequences $a:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ such
                that $\sum_{n}a_{n}^{2}=1$. Finitely supported simply means
                there is an $N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that for all $n>N$ it is
                true that $a_{n}=0$.
            \end{example}
            \begin{example}
                The Hilbert cube, which is a subset of $\nspace[\infty]$, can
                be made into a CW complex since it is the union of
                $\prod_{k=1}^{n}[0,\frac{1}{n}]^{n}$ for all $n$. This is
                another example of an infinite dimensional CW complex. Unlike
                $\mathbb{RP}^{\infty}$ and $\nsphere[\infty]$, it is a compact
                infinite dimensional space.

                We've now constructed most of the simple structures one can
                obtain from a square, and we proceed by describing the last one.
                The torus is obtained by identifying opposite sides of a square,
                the M\"{o}bius strip identified only two sides but with
                a twist, and the real projective plane had lots of twists. The
                final space is half-way between a torus and $\mathbb{RP}^{2}$.
                That is, we twist one side but not the other. The result is
                called a Klein bottle and its representation is shown in

                Similar to the torus, real projective plane, and M\"{o}bius

                nice parameterization we may draw in $\nspace[3]$. Unlike the
                real projective plane, however, this does give us a nice
                immersion into $\nspace[3]$ which may be of interest to
                differential topologists. The resulting image of this immersion
                is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Klein_Bottle}. Similar to the real
                projective plane, there is no embedding into $\nspace[3]$ and
                any realization of the Klein bottle in three dimensions must
                cross itself. This quotient shows that the Klein bottle can be

            We've seen these numbers before since the torus can be obtained from
            one 0-cell, two 1-cells, and one 2-cell. This is not to suggest the
            Klein bottle and torus are homeomorphic, they are not since the
            torus is orientable. Without resorting to such sophisticated methods
            we can simply use our subspace tool. We may remove one circle from
            the torus and obtain a cylinder. Removing a circle from a cylinder
            will disconnect the space, and hence we may remove at most one
            circle from the torus without disconnecting it. From the Klein
            bottle we can remove two. If we cut the toroidal part of
            Fig.~\ref{fig:Klein_Bottle} (the blue part near the bottom) we are
            left with a M\"{o}bius strip. That is, we have the quotient in
            Fig.~\ref{fig:Square_to_Klein_Bottle} but we neglect gluing the
            $b$ sides together. We have a piece of paper, introduce a twist, and
            then glue together which is the instructions for a M\"{o}bius strip.
            But the M\"{o}bius band has an inner circle which we can remove
            without disconnecting the space.
            \par\hfill\par
            This shows more concretely that the torus and Klein bottle are not
            the same, even though they have the same
            \textit{Euler characteristic}. Given a finite dimensional CW complex
            we compute the Euler characteristic by computing the alternating sum
            of the number of cells in the $n$ skeleton. That is, we take the
            number of 0-cells, subtract the number of 1-cells, add the number of
            2-cells, and so on up to the dimension of the space. For example,
            the sphere is obtained from one 0-cell and one 2-cell so we have
            $\chi_{\nsphere[2]}=1-0+1=2$, where the greek letter \textit{chi} is
            often used to denote Euler characteristic. It is a remarkable
            theorem that the Euler characteristic of CW complexes is invariant
            under choice of skeletons. We saw the the sphere can be realized as
            one 0-cell, one 1-cell, and two 2-cells, yielding $1-1+2=2$. The
            house with two rooms has 36 points, 60 edges, and 25 faces. The
            Euler characteristic is $36-60+25=1$. But we said the house with
            two rooms was contractible meaning it is homotopy equivalent to a
            point, which has Euler characteristic 1. Not only does the Euler
            characteristic respect CW complexes, it is invariant under homotopy
            equivalence.

            \begin{minipage}[t]{0.64\textwidth}
                Let's see why the Euler characteristic is preserved by
                examining the torus. There is another slightly obvious way of
                representing this as a CW complex, and this is shown in
                Fig.~\ref{fig:Alt_CW_Complex_Torus}. Here we have attached
                a one cell along the diagonal of the square. Since all of the
                corners are identified, we have attached a single 1-cell to our
                singleton 0-cell. The result is a curve that wraps around the
                torus once.

            We can see what this structure looks like in
            Fig.~\ref{fig:Alt_CW_Complex_for_Torus_3D}. By adding a new 1-cell
            to our complex we've split our single face into two. That is, adding
            a 1-cell also created a 2-cell since our square split into two
            triangles. The original CW complex consisted of one 0-cell, two
            1-cells, and one 2-cell, the Euler characteristic being $1-2+1=0$.
            In our new complex we have one 0-cell, three 1-cells, and two
            2-cells. Computing the Euler characteristic gives us $1-3+2=0$. More
            suggestively, $1-(2+1)+(1+1)=1-2+1+(1-1)=1-2+1$ which shows us why
            the Euler characteristic is invariant to the introduction of more
            1-cells. This is not a rigorous proof for the general CW complex,
            but is how Euler proved this for the case of convex polyhedron.
            Since these are homeomorphic to $\nsphere[2]$ the Euler
            characteristic is 2.

                CW complexes can be messy. There is no requirement that the $n$
                skeleton attaches to the $n-1$ skeleton in any nice way, the
                maps need only be continuous. As such we can create the
                following creature shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Messy_CW_Complex}
                consisting of one 0-cell, one 1-cell, and one 2-cell. We attach
                the 1-cell to the 0-cell in the only way possible, mapping
                $\partial\nsphere[1]$ to $\{0\}$, which gives us a circle
                $\nsphere[1]$. From here we glue a sphere onto the circle,
                avoiding the 0-cell.

            This is allowed since there's no requirement that the attaching
            maps glue $\partial\ndisk$ to parts of the $k$ skeleton for all
            $k<n$. The $\varphi_{\alpha}$ need only attach

                Now we ponder performing a similar operation, but with two

                \textit{not} a CW complex since the second sphere is attached
                to another sphere, and not to the 1-skeleton $X^{1}$. This space
                is homeomorphic to a CW complex since we can simply introduce
                more points and edges, but as we have currently drawn it is not.

            \subsection{Subcomplexes and CW Pairs}
                \begin{minipage}[t]{0.6\textwidth}
                    We now discuss the notion of \textit{subcomplex}, an example
                    of this comes from studying the sphere. We have seen two
                    possible CW structures on $\nsphere[2]$, one 0-cell with one
                    2-cell, and one 0-cell with one 1-cell and two 2-cells.
                    The benefit of the latter is that it contains the equator as
                    an obvious subset, it's the 1-skeleton. Even better we can
                    inductively obtain $\nsphere[n+1]$ from $\nsphere$ by
                    equipping the space with two $k$-cells for all
                    $k=0,1,\dots,n$.

                \par\vspace{2.5ex}
                The zero dimensional sphere is just two points, which is a CW
                complex with a rather simple 0-skeleton. From here we attach two
                intervals to obtain $\nsphere[1]$, and this is shown in
                Fig.~\ref{fig:CW_Complex_S1}. Next we attach two disks on top of
                this to obtain $\nsphere[2]$. Another CW complex can be given by
                two 0-cells, attaching two 1-cells between them giving us an
                equator, and two 2-cells forming hemispheres. Hence we have two
                0-cells, two 1-cells, and two 2-cells. The benefit of this
                construction is that it contains $\nsphere[0]$ (which is two
                points) and $\nsphere[1]$ as \textit{subcomplexes}. Constructing
                CW complexes using nice subcomplexes has its benefits.
                $\mathbb{RP}^{2}$ can be realized as the quotient of
                $\nsphere[2]$ identifying antepodal points. If we think of the
                sphere as two 0-cells, two 1-cells, and two 2-cells we can see
                that $\mathbb{RP}^{2}$ has the structure of a CW complex
                containing one 0-cell, one 1-cell, and one 2-cell since the
                cells in $\nsphere[2]$ are glued together. Similarly since
                $\nsphere$ can be written using two $k$-cells for $k=0,\dots,n$,
                $\mathbb{RP}^{n}$ can be written using one $k$-cell for each
                $k=0,\dots,n$. This also allows us to construct
                $\mathbb{RP}^{\infty}$ since $\mathbb{RP}^{n}$ can be seen as a
                subcomplex of $\mathbb{RP}^{n+1}$. This view of
                $\mathbb{RP}^{\infty}$ agrees with the notion of identifying
                lines in $\nspace[\infty]$ (finitely supported sequences).
                \par\hfill\par
                A subcomplex is a closed subspace of a CW complex that is itself
                the union of cells from the ambient space. A subcomplex
                $A\subseteq{X}$ of a CW complex is often denoted $(A,X)$ and
                this is called a CW pair. If we look at $\nsphere[\infty]$ as
                the CW complex consisting of two $n$-cells for all
                $n\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $\nsphere$ is contained as a
                subcomplex for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$, then there is a 2-to-1
                quotient map into $\mathbb{RP}^{\infty}$ that respects the cell
                structure. That is, $n$-cells in $\nsphere[\infty]$ map to
                $n$-cells in $\mathbb{RP}^{\infty}$.
                \subsection{The Topology of CW Complexes}
                    In the construction of CW complexes there is no intrinsic
                    metric we consider on the cells, we only consider their
                    topology. Hence one should think of a 0-cell as a point,
                    1-cells as edges, and two cells as bubbles. In many examples
                    CW Complexes tend to be metric spaces, but this is not a
                    requirement, nor is it provable based on the construction.
                    Indeed, finite dimensional CW complexes need not be first
                    countable. A zero dimensional CW complex is just the
                    disjoint union of points endowed with the discrete topology,
                    and this is indeed a metric space. The only discerning
                    characteristic of zero dimensional CW complexes is the
                    cardinality. Hence for an example of a CW complex that is
                    not first countable we must look to one dimensional
                    structures. Let us now construct such an example.
                    \par\hfill\par
                    Let $X^{0}=\vector{0}$ consist of a single point and
                    $X^{1}=\coprod_{n\in\mathbb{N}}I$. That is, the disjoint
                    union of countably many intervals. An element is denoted
                    $(n,x)$ with $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and $x\in{I}$. The attaching
                    maps send $(n,0)$ and $(n,1)$ to $\vector{0}$ for all
                    $n\in\mathbb{N}$, so we obtain countably many circles which
                    are connected at a single point. The CW Complex topology is
                    then just the normal quotient topology since this is 1
                    dimensional. The resulting space is not first countable
                    since $[\vector{0}]$ does not have a countable neighborhood
                    basis. For suppose it does and let $\mathcal{B}$ be such a
                    basis. Since $\mathcal{B}$ is hypothesized to be countable,
                    there is a surjection
                    $\mathcal{U}:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathcal{B}$. Since
                    $\mathcal{U}_{n}\in\mathcal{B}$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$,
                    $\mathcal{U}_{n}$ is open. But a set is open if and only if
                    $\pi^{\minus{1}}[\mathcal{U}_{n}]$ is open where $\pi$ is
                    the canonical projection map. Since
                    $[\vector{0}]\in\mathcal{U}_{n}$,
                    $[(n,0)],[(n,1)]\in\mathcal{U}_{n}$ since
                    $[\vector{0}]=[(n,0)]=[(n,1)]$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$. But
                    then $(n,0)$ and $(n,1)$ are elements of
                    $\pi^{\minus{1}}[\mathcal{U}_{n}]$. Since
                    $\pi^{\minus{1}}[\mathcal{U}_{n}]$ is open there exists
                    $a_{n}>0$ and $b_{n}>0$ such that
                    $\{n\}\times[0,a_{n})\subseteq\pi^{\minus{1}}[\mathcal{U}_{n}]$
                    and
                    $\{n\}\times(b_{n},1]\subseteq\pi^{\minus{1}}[\mathcal{U}_{n}]$.
                    Let $r_{n}=\min\{a_{n},b_{n},\frac{1}{2}\}/2$ and define:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \mathcal{O}=
                        \{\vector{0}\}\cup\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\Big(
                            \big(\{n\}\times[0,r_{n})\big)
                            \cup\big(\{n\}\times(r_{n},1]\big)
                        \Big)
                    \end{equation}
                    Then $\mathcal{O}$ is open in the disjoint topology and is
                    saturated since
                    $\pi^{\minus{1}}\big[\pi[\mathcal{O}]\big]=\mathcal{O}$.
                    Therefore $[\mathcal{O}]=\pi[\mathcal{O}]$ is open and
                    contains $[\vector{0}]$. But if $[\mathcal{O}]$ contains
                    $[\vector{0}]$, then since $\mathcal{B}$ is a neighborhood
                    basis of $[\vector{0}]$ there is a
                    $\mathcal{V}\in\mathcal{B}$ such that
                    $\mathcal{V}\subseteq[\mathcal{O}]$. But $\mathcal{U}$ is
                    surjective so there is an $N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that
                    $\mathcal{U}_{N}=\mathcal{V}$. But
                    $\pi[\{N\}\times(r_{N},a_{N})]\subseteq\mathcal{U}_{N}$ and
                    $\pi[\{N\}\times(r_{N},a_{N})]\nsubseteq[\mathcal{O}]$, a
                    contradiction since $\mathcal{U}\subseteq[\mathcal{O}]$.
                    Hence, $\mathcal{B}$ is not a neighborhood basis. Since
                    metric spaces are first countable, this is not a metric
                    space.
                    \par\hfill\par
                    Some comments. We've used countable choice for the $r_{n}$.
                    A sequential space is a topological space where sequences
                    suffices to define openness. $\mathcal{U}\subseteq{X}$ is
                    open if and only if for every sequence converging to a point
                    in $\mathcal{U}$, the sequence is \textit{eventually}
                    contained in $\mathcal{U}$. That is, open and sequentially
                    open are identical. Open always implies sequentially open,
                    the converse may fail (cocountable topology on
                    $\mathbb{R}$). In a sequential space continuity and
                    sequential continuity are identical. A very mild condition
                    that a space be sequential is first countability. It is not
                    necessary, just sufficient. A necessary and sufficient
                    condition is the following:
                    \begin{theorem}
                        A topological space $\topspace{X}$ is sequential if and
                        only if it is the quotient of a metric space.
                    \end{theorem}
                    Since the disjoint union of metric spaces is still a metric
                    space (assuming axiom of choice), and since CW complex are
                    obtained from quotients of these, CW complexes are indeed
                    sequential. Hence, sequences suffice to prove continuity.
                    \begin{definition}
                        A sequential topological space is a topological space
                        $\topspace{X}$ such that $\mathcal{U}\subseteq{X}$ is
                        open if and only if $\mathcal{U}$ is sequentially open.
                        That is, for every sequence $a:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow{X}$
                        with a limit $x\in\mathcal{U}$ there exists
                        $N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that for all $n>N$ it is true that
                        $a_{n}\in\mathcal{U}$.
                    \end{definition}
                    We say \textit{a} limit since no separation axioms are
                    assumed, hence limits need not be unique. Since CW complexes
                    are Hausdorff this does not cause concern.
                    \begin{theorem}
                        Open implies sequentially open.
                    \end{theorem}
                    \begin{proof}
                        By the definition of convergence. If
                        $a_{n}\rightarrow{x}$, then for every open $\mathcal{V}$
                        containing $x$ there is an $N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that
                        for all $n>N$ it is true that $a_{n}\in\mathcal{V}$.
                        Setting $\mathcal{V}=\mathcal{U}$ gives the result.
                    \end{proof}
                    \begin{theorem}
                        Continuous implies sequentially continuous.
                    \end{theorem}
                    \begin{proof}
                        Standard topological result.
                    \end{proof}
                    \begin{theorem}
                        First countable implies sequential.

                    \begin{proof}
                        Another standard theorem.

                    \begin{theorem}
                        Metrizable spaces are sequential.
                    \end{theorem}
                    \begin{proof}
                        For metrizable implies first countable, which implies
                        sequential.
                    \end{proof}
                    \begin{theorem}
                        If $\topspace[\alpha]{X_{\alpha}}$ are a collection of
                        sequential spaces, if $Y=\coprod_{\alpha}X_{\alpha}$,
                        and if $\tau$ is the disjoint union topology, then
                        $\topspace{Y}$ is sequential.
                    \end{theorem}
                    \begin{proof}
                        For suppose $\mathcal{V}\subseteq{Y}$ is sequentially
                        open but not open. But $\mathcal{V}$ is open if and only
                        if for all $\alpha$, the pre-image under the canonical
                        inclusion mapping
                        $\iota_{\alpha}:X_{\alpha}\rightarrow{Y}$ is open. That
                        is, $\iota_{\alpha}^{\minus{1}}[\mathcal{V}]$ is open.
                        Hence if $\mathcal{V}$ is \textit{not} open, then there
                        exists an $\alpha$ such such that
                        $\iota_{\alpha}^{\minus{1}}[\mathcal{V}]\subseteq{X}_{\alpha}$
                        is not open. Let $\mathcal{U}=\iota_{\alpha}^{\minus{1}}[\mathcal{V}]$.
                        But $X_{\alpha}$ is sequential and hence if $\mathcal{U}$
                        is not open, then it is not sequentially open. But then
                        there is a sequence $a:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow{X}_{\alpha}$
                        with a limit $x\in\mathcal{U}$ such that for all
                        $N\in\mathbb{N}$ there is an $n>N$ with
                        $a_{n}\notin\mathcal{U}$. But $\iota_{\alpha}$ is
                        continuous and hence
                        $\iota_{\alpha}(a_{n})\rightarrow\iota_{\alpha}(x)$. But
                        $\iota_{\alpha}(x)\in\mathcal{V}$ and $\mathcal{V}$ is
                        sequentially continuous. Therefore there is an
                        $N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that for all $n>N$ it is true that
                        $\iota_{\alpha}(a_{n})\in\mathcal{V}$. But then for all
                        $n>N$, $a_{n}\in\mathcal{U}$, a contradiction. Hence,
                        $\mathcal{U}$ is open and $\mathcal{V}$ is also open.
                        That is, $Y$ is sequential.
                    \end{proof}
                    \begin{theorem}[Exercise 2.4G of Engelking's Topology]
                        If $\topspace[X]{X}$ and $\topspace[Y]{Y}$ are
                        topological spaces, if $X$ is sequential, and if
                        $q:X\rightarrow{Y}$ is a quotient map, then $Y$ is
                        sequential.
                    \end{theorem}
                    \begin{proof}
                        For let $\mathcal{V}\subseteq{Y}$ be sequentially open.
                        It suffices to prove $\mathcal{V}$ is open. Let
                        $\mathcal{U}=q^{\minus{1}}[\mathcal{V}]$ and suppose
                        this is not open. But $X$ is sequential and hence
                        $\mathcal{U}$ is not sequentially open. But then there
                        is a sequence $a:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow{X}$ with a limit
                        $x\in\mathcal{U}$ such that for all $N\in\mathbb{N}$
                        there is an $n\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $n>N$ and
                        $a_{n}\notin\mathcal{U}$. But $q$ is continuous, and
                        hence sequentially continuous, and therefore
                        $q(a_{n})\rightarrow{q}(x)$. But $q(x)\in\mathcal{V}$
                        and $\mathcal{V}$ is sequentially open, hence there is
                        an $N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that for all $n>N$ it is true
                        that $q(a_{n})\in\mathcal{V}$. But then for all $n>N$ we
                        have $a_{n}\in\mathcal{U}$, a contradiction. Hence,
                        $\mathcal{U}$ is open. But $\mathcal{V}$ is open if and
                        only if $q^{\minus{1}}[\mathcal{V}]$ is open, and
                        therefore $\mathcal{V}$ is open. That is, $Y$ is
                        sequential.
                    \end{proof}
                    \begin{theorem}
                        If $\topspace{X}$ is a finite dimensional CW complex,
                        then it is sequential.
                    \end{theorem}
                    \begin{proof}
                        We prove by induction on the dimension. The base case
                        $n=0$ is trivially true since the disjoint union of
                        points is a discrete space which is metrizable, and
                        therefore sequential. Suppose it is true for
                        $n\in\mathbb{N}$. If $X$ is an $n+1$ dimensional CW
                        complex then it is of the form $X^{n}\coprod{X}^{n+1}/\sim$
                        where $X^{n}$ is an $n$ dimensional CW complex, $X^{n+1}$
                        is the disjoint union of $n+1$ dimensional closed balls,
                        and $\sim$ is the equivalence relation induced by the
                        attaching maps of the $n+1$ skeleton into $X^{n}$. But
                        $X^{n}$ is sequential by hypothesis, and $X^{n+1}$ is
                        the disjoint union of $n+1$ balls, which is metrizable,
                        and hence sequential. But the disjoint union of
                        sequential spaces is sequential, and hence
                        $X^{n}\coprod{X}^{n+1}$ is sequential. But then
                        $X^{n}\coprod{X}^{n+1}/\sim$ is the quotient of a
                        sequential space, and is therefore sequential. Therefore,
                        finite dimensional CW complexes are sequential.
                    \end{proof}
                    \begin{theorem}
                        If $X$ is a CW complex, then it is sequential.
                    \end{theorem}
                    \begin{proof}
                        If $X$ is a finite dimensional CW complex, then we are
                        done. So suppose not and let $\mathcal{U}\subseteq{X}$
                        be sequentially open. To show that it is open suffices
                        to check that $\mathcal{U}\cap{X}^{n}$ is an open subset
                        of $X^{n}$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$. But $X^{n}$ is
                        sequential, and hence if $\mathcal{U}\cap{X}^{n}$ is not
                        open, then it is not sequentially open. But then there
                        is a sequence $a:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow{X}^{n}$ with
                        limit $x\in\mathcal{U}\cap{X}^{n}$ such that for all
                        $K\in\mathbb{N}$ there is an $k>K$ such that
                        $a_{k}\notin\mathcal{U}\cap{X}^{n}$. But $\mathcal{U}$
                        is sequential, hence if $a_{k}\rightarrow{x}$ and
                        $x\in\mathcal{U}$, then there is a $K\in\mathbb{N}$ such
                        that for all $k>K$ it is true that $a_{k}\in\mathcal{U}$.
                        But for all $k\in\mathbb{N}$ we have $a_{k}\in{X}^{k}$
                        by definition since $a$ is a sequence in $X^{n}$, and
                        hence for all $k>K$ we have $a_{k}\in\mathcal{U}\cap{X}^{n}$,
                        a contradiction. Therefore $\mathcal{U}\cap{X}^{n}$ is
                        sequentially open, and thus open in $X^{n}$. But this is
                        true of all $n\in\mathbb{N}$, and hence $\mathcal{U}$ is
                        open.
                    \end{proof}
                    \par\hfill\par
                    Since the attaching maps $\varphi_{\alpha}$ of a CW complex
                    only glue along the boundary of a cell $e_{\alpha}^{n}$,
                    $\varphi_{\alpha}$ restricts to a homeomorphism on the
                    interior of $e_{\alpha}^{n}$, which itself is homeomorphic
                    to $\nball$.

            \subsection{Operations on CW complexes}
                The product of CW complexes is again a CW complex. For example,
                if we take $\ntorus[]\times\nsphere[2]$, we can note that
                $\ntorus[]$ consists of one 0-cell, two 1-cells, and one 2-cell,
                and that $\nsphere[2]$ contains one 0-cell and one 2-cell. Using
                this we have $\ntorus[]\times\nsphere[2]$ contains
                one 0-cell, two 1-cells, two 2-cells, two 3-cells, and one
                4-cell. It should be noted that, in general, the CW product need
                not coincide with the product topology. This occurs if two
                starting spaces are finite, or if they are locally compact.
                \par\hfill\par
                The quotient of a CW complex by a subcomplex is again a CW
                complex. It has the skeleton of all cells in $X\setminus\{A\}$
                together with a single point which corresponds to $A$. That is,
                the subcomplex $A$ is collapsed to a single point by the
                quotient. The attaching maps are obtained by
                $\nsphere[n-1]\rightarrow{X}^{n-1}\rightarrow{X}^{n-1}/A^{n-1}$.
                \par\hfill\par
                The cone of a topology space $\topspace{X}$ is the quotient
                space induced on $X\times{I}$ by identifying $X\times\{0\}$ to a
                single point. One of the nice properties of the cone of a space,
                which is occasionally denoted $CX$, though one should not
                confuse this with $\Ckspace[X]{}{X}$, the space of continuous
                functions $f:X\rightarrow{X}$ (which some authors write as
                $C(X)$), is that the cone is always contractible. The cone can
                also be thought as connecting every poinit of $X$ via a line
                segment to some external point and the construction we've given
                is a means to topologize this notion.
                \par\hfill\par
                The suspension of a topological space $X$ is the quotient of
                $X\times{I}$ obtained by identitying $X\times\{0\}$ to a point
                and $X\times\{1\}$ to a different point. The suspension of
                $\nsphere$ is then $S\nsphere=\nsphere[n+1]$. There is a CW
                complex on this provided $X$ was a CW complex, we need to
                introduce two 0-cells and two 1-cells. There is also a
                suspension of a continuous function $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ by
                mapping $X\times{I}$ into $Y\times{I}$ by
                $(x,t)\mapsto(f(x),t)$ and then we pass this to the quotient.

                    \label{fig:Suspension_of_Circle}
                \end{figure}
                \begin{example}
                    Consider the suspension of $\nsphere[2]$, First we draw
                    $\nsphere[2]\times{I}$ which can be visualized as the region
                    bounded between two concentric circles. To obtain the
                    suspension of $\nsphere[2]$ we must collapse the two
                    bounding sphere of our region to a single point. First we
                    collapse the inner sphere to a point and leave the outer one
                    untouched. The result is simply the closed ball in
                    $\nsphere[3]$, $\closure[]{\nball[3]}$. Hence the suspension
                    is just the quotient space of the closed ball which
                    identifies the entire boundary with a single point. But this
                    is just a description of $\nsphere[3]$ showing that
                    $S\nsphere[2]=\nsphere[3]$.
                \end{example}
                \begin{figure}[H]

                \end{figure}
                The join of $X$ and $Y$ is similar to the suspension but allows
                for an easier CW complex. We take $X\times{Y}\times{I}$ and
                collapse $X\times{Y}\times\{0\}$ to $X$ and
                $X\times{Y}\times\{1\}$ to $Y$. That is,
                $(x,y_{1},0)R(x,y_{2},0)$ for all $y_{1},y_{2}\in{Y}$ and
                $x\in{X}$, and similarly $(x_{1},y,1)R(x_{2},y,1)$ for all
                $x_{1},x_{2}\in{X}$ and $y\in{Y}$. We then equip this with the
                quotient topology and label this the join of $X$ and $Y$,
                denoted $X*Y$. The join is associative and commutative
                \textit{up to homeomorphism}. Similar to the cone, the join can
                be thought of as connecting a line segment between every point
                in $X$ with every point in $Y$ and giving it a topology. With
                this in mind it is easier to compute example.
                \begin{example}
                    The join of two points is a line segment, homeomorphic to
                    $I$. The space starts with
                    $\{x_{0}\}\times\{y_{0}\}\times{I}$ and then we quotient out
                    $\{x_{0}\}\times\{y_{0}\}\times\{0\}$ to a single point and
                    similarly for $\{x_{0}\}\times\{y_{0}\}\times\{1\}$. But
                    both of these sets are already one point sets and hence the
                    quotient does nothing. So we have $\{x_{0}\}*\{y_{0}\}$ is
                    homeomorphic to $I$.
                \end{example}
                \begin{example}
                    There is double meaning to the join of three points. We
                    could mean the join of a two point space with a one point
                    space, or the join of a one point space with a one point
                    space, and then again join this with a one point space.
                    In the first meaning we get a $V$ and in the second we get
                    the join of an interval with a point. Since we are simply
                    connecting all of the point of the first space with all of
                    the points in the second the result is a triangle with its
                    interior included. In the first interpretation if we join
                    the $m$ point space with the $n$ point space the result is
                    the bipartite graph $K_{mn}$, where as in the latter meaning
                    joing $n$ points results in the $n$ simplex $\Delta^{n}$.
                \end{example}

                \begin{example}
                    A nice example to help visualize joins is the join of the
                    unit interval with itself. The product space before the
                    quotient takes place is then just $I\times{I}\times{I}$
                    which is the closed unit cube. The quotient then collapse
                    the left face of the cube vertically and the right face of
                    the cube horizontally.
                \end{example}

                The wedge of two topological spaces $X$ and $Y$ with respect to
                point $x_{0}\in{X}$ and $y_{0}\in{Y}$ is the space
                $X\coprod{Y}$ where we quotient out $x_{0}$ and $y_{0}$. That is
                we attach $X$ to $Y$ at the point $y_{0}$ by gluing $x_{0}$.
                $X^{n}/X^{n-1}$ is homeomorphic to the wedge of copies of
                $\nsphere$.

                If $X$ and $Y$ are homogeneous topological spaces, then the
                wedge is invariant under choice of point up to homeomorphism.
                Homogeneous simply means given $x_{1},x_{2}\in{X}$ there is an
                autohomeomorphism $f:X\rightarrow{X}$ such that
                $f(x_{1})=x_{2}$.

                The wedge of countably infinite copies of the circle is not
                homeomorphic to the Hawaiian earrings. There is a rather clear
                bijection between these two as sets, but the topologies are
                different. The Hawaiian earrings are a closed and bounded subset
                of $\nspace[2]$ and is hence compact, but the wedge of
                infinitely many circles is not even locally compact.

                The smash product is obtained by quotienting out $X\times{Y}$ by
                $X\lor{Y}$ since there is a copy of $X\lor{Y}$ contained in
                $X\times{Y}$ for any two chosen points $x_{0}\in{X}$ and
                $y_{0}\in{Y}$. Namely, take the union of $X\times\{y_{0}\}$ and
                $\{x_{0}\}\times{Y}$. For $n,m\in\mathbb{N}$ the smash product
                $\nsphere[n]\land\nsphere[m]$ is homeomorphic to $\nsphere[n+m]$
                via a simple combinatorial argument. We have an $n+m$ ball
                attaching to a single vertex, and there's only one way to do
                this. We can describe this for $n=m=0$ and draw this for
                $n=m=1$ fairly easily. For $n=m=0$, $\nsphere[0]$ is the two
                point set so $\nsphere[0]\times\nsphere[0]$ is the 4 point set.
                We are collapsing pairs which again gives us a 2 point set. For
                $n=0$ and $m=1$ we have $\nsphere[0]\times\nsphere[1]$ is the
                disjoint union of two circles. By quotienting out by
                $\nsphere[0]\lor\nsphere[1]$ we are placing the first circle on
                top of the second one, giving us a single circle. Lastly, for
                $n=m=1$ we note that $\nsphere[1]\times\nsphere[1]$ is the torus
                $\ntorus[]$ and by quotienting out $\nsphere[1]\lor\nsphere[1]$
                we are collapsing the two inner circles.

                \end{figure}
                In this image we collapse the blue circle down to the origin,
                and then the red circle. We obtain a scrunched up object which
                is homeomorphic to a sphere.
            \subsection{Homotopy Extension Property}
                If $A$ is a contractible subcomplex of $X$, then $X/A$ is
                homotopy equivalent to $X$. We will use this to prove that any
                connected one dimensional CW complex is homotopy equivalent to
                the wedge of circles. We've seen some use of this before when
                discussing lemniscates and the double punctured plane. For
                another example consider the graph shown below, which is the
                complete graph on 4 vertices $K_{4}$. We take every edge that
                touches the central vertex and collapse it down to a point. The
                result is the wedge of three circles.
                \begin{figure}[H]

                    \label{fig:Homotopy_Equivalent_to_K4}
                \end{figure}
                To prove this firsts requires a discussion of the homotopy
                extension property. A topological space $\topspace[X]{X}$ is
                said to have the homotopy extension property with respect to a
                subspace $A\subseteq{X}$ if for any other topological space
                $\topspace[Y]{Y}$ and for any two continuous functions
                $f:X\times\{0\}\rightarrow{Y}$ and $g:A\times{I}\rightarrow{Y}$
                such that $f|_{A\times\{0\}}=g|_{A\times\{0\}}$, then $g$ may be
                extended to a homotopy $\tilde{f}:X\times{I}\rightarrow{Y}$. Now
                this definition is not particularly useful since to use it we
                must show for \textit{any} topological space $\topspace[Y]{Y}$
                we choose and for \textit{any} such pair of functions $f,g$ one
                can extend to create a homotopy. This is a ridiculous task.
                Fortunately, it can be significantly weakened to the following.
                A subspace $A\subseteq{X}$ admits the homotopy extension
                property if and only if $(X\times\{0\})\cup(A\times{I})$ is a
                retract of $X\times{I}$. Unfortunately, this makes the
                hypothesis of the following theorem quite verbose.
                \begin{ftheorem}{Homotopy Extension Theorem}
                                {Homotopy_Extension_Theorem}
                    If $\topspace[X]{X}$ is a topological space,
                    $A\subseteq{X}$, if
                    $r:X\times{I}\rightarrow(X\times\{0\})\cup(A\times{I})$ is a
                    retract where $X\times{I}$ and
                    $(X\times\{0\})\cup(A\times{I})$ carry the product and
                    subspace topologies, respectively, if $\topspace[Y]{Y}$ is a
                    topological space, and if
                    $f:(X\times\{0\})\cup(A\times{I})\rightarrow{Y}$ is
                    continuous, then there is a continuous function
                    $\tilde{f}:X\times{I}$ such that
                    $\tilde{f}|_{X\times\{0\})\cup(A\times{I})}=f$.
                \end{ftheorem}
                \begin{bproof}
                    For let $\tilde{f}=f\circ{r}$. Since $\tilde{f}$ is the
                    composition of continuous functions, it is continuous. But
                    for all $x\in(X\times\{0\})\cup(A\times{I})$ we have
                    $\tilde{f}=f(r(x))=f(x)$ since $r$ is a retract onto
                    $(X\times\{0\})\cup(A\times{I})$. Hence $\tilde{f}$ is a
                    continuous function which is restricts to $f$ on
                    $(X\times\{0\})\cup(A\times{I})$.
                \end{bproof}
                The converse is trivial and the hypothesis is absolute overkill.
                We don't need \textit{for every} topological space
                $\topspace[Y]{Y}$ and \textit{for every} continuous function, we
                simply need the premise to hold for
                $(X\times\{0\})\cup(A\times{I})$ and the identity map on this
                space. Hence, the converse states:
                \begin{theorem}
                    If $\topspace{X}$ is a topological space, if
                    $A\subseteq{X}$, and if the identity map
                    $\identity{(X\times\{0\})\cup(A\times{I})}:%
                    (X\times\{0\})\cup(A\times{I})\rightarrow%
                    (X\times\{0\})\cup(A\times{I})$ extends to a continuous
                    function
                    $f:X\times{I}\rightarrow(X\times\{0\})\cup(A\times{I})$,
                    then there is a retract
                    $r:X\times{I}\rightarrow(X\times\{0\})\cup(A\times{I})$.
                \end{theorem}
                \begin{proof}
                    For let $r=f$. Then $f$ is a retract since by hypothesis,
                    $f$ restricts to the identity on
                    $(X\times\{0\})\cup(A\times{I})$. But $f$ is continuous and
                    the image of $f$ lies in $(X\times\{0\})\cup(A\times{I})$,
                    and therefore $f$ is a retract.
                \end{proof}
                If is often nice to be able to characterize certain properties
                about a topological space $\topspace{X}$ with respect to every
                other space that can be determined solely by examining $X$. If
                one were asked to prove directly that for any space one can
                think of this extension property holds one would be inclined to
                give up rather quickly since at the start you are given nothing
                about this external space $Y$.
                \begin{theorem}
                    If $\topspace{X}$ is a topological space, if
                    $f:X\rightarrow{X}$ is a continuous function, and if:
                    \begin{equation}
                        A=\{\,x\in{X}\;|\;f(x)=x\,\}
                    \end{equation}
                    Then $A\subseteq{X}$ is closed.
                \end{theorem}
                \begin{proof}
                    For if $X$ is Hausdorff, then the set:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \Delta=\{\,(x,x)\in{X}\times{X}\;|\;x\in{X}\,\}
                    \end{equation}
                    is closed in the product topology. Let
                    $F:X\rightarrow{X}\times{X}$ denote the function
                    $F(x)=(x,f(x))$. Then since $F$ is continuous in both
                    components, $F$ is continuous. But then since $\Delta$ is
                    closed, $F^{\minus{1}}[\Delta]$ is closed, as $F$ is
                    continuous. But $F^{\minus{1}}[\Delta]=A$. Therefore, $A$ is
                    closed.
                \end{proof}
                \begin{theorem}
                    If $\topspace{X}$ is a Hausdorff topological space, if
                    $A\subseteq{X}$, and if $(X\times\{0\})\cup(A\times{I})$ is
                    a retract of $X\times{I}$ with respect to the product
                    topology, then $A$ is a closed subset of $X$.
                \end{theorem}
                \begin{proof}
                    Since $X$ is Hausdorff, $X\times{I}$ is Hausdorff in the
                    product topology. But if $r$ is a retraction, then
                    $r|(X\times\{0\})\cup(A\times{I})$ is the identity map and
                    moreover $r[X\times{I}]=(X\times\{0\})\cup(A\times{I})$.
                    Hence the image $r[X\times{I}]$ may be written as:
                    \begin{equation}
                        r[X\times{I}]=\{\,z\in{X}\times{I}\;|\;r(z)=z\,\}
                    \end{equation}
                    But the set of fixed points under a continuous map from a
                    Hausdorff space to itself is closed. But then
                    $(X\times\{0\})\cup(A\times{I})$ is closed in $X\times{I}$,
                    so it's complement is open. But then the projection of the
                    complement is open, and this is just $X\setminus{A}$. But if
                    $X\setminus{A}$ is open, then $A$ is closed.
                \end{proof}
                \begin{example}
                    Not every subspace of a given topological space need have
                    the homotopy extension, not even \textit{nice} subspaces of
                    well-behaved topological spaces. Take $X=I$ and $A$ the set
                    of all points of the form $x=1/n$ with $n\in\mathbb{N}^{+}$
                    and add the point $0$ in as well. Then
                    $(X\times\{0\})\cup(A\times{I})$ is the comb space which
                    we've grown to love. Since there is no retraction of the
                    unit square $I\times{I}=X\times{I}$ to the comb space, the
                    pair $(X,A)$ does not have the homotopy extension property.
                \end{example}
                To get back to CW complexes we need to show that any CW
                subcomplex gives rise to the homotopy extension property. We do
                this in two steps. First we show that
                $\closure[]{\nball}\times{I}$ can be retracted to
                $(\closure[]{\nball}\times\{0\})\cup(\nsphere[n-1]\times{I})$.
                The picture for this goes as follows, we take
                $(\vector{x},t)\in\closure[]{\nball}\times{I}$ and consider the
                line between $(\vector{x},t)$ and $(\vector{0},2)$ which sits in
                $\nspace[n+1]$. We then follow this line until it hits the
                boundary of $\closure[]{\nball}\times{I}$. This operation is a
                continuous retract, as desired. The following theorem merely
                spells out the details.
                \begin{theorem}
                    If $X=\closure[]{\nball}$ denotes the usual closed ball in
                    $\nspace$, and if $\tau$ is its usual subspace topology,
                    then there is a retract
                    $r:X\times{I}\rightarrow(X\times\{0\})\cup(\nsphere[n-1]\times{I})$
                    where both spaces carry the product and subspace topologies,
                    respectively.
                \end{theorem}
                \begin{proof}
                    Let
                    $r:X\times{I}\rightarrow(X\times\{0\})\cup(\nsphere[n-1]\times{I})$
                    be defined by:
                    \begin{equation}
                        f(\vector{x},t)=
                        \begin{cases}
                            \frac{1}{\norm{\vector{x}}_{2}^{n}}(\vector{x},t)+
                            (1-\frac{1}{\norm{\vector{x}}_{2}^{n}})
                            (\vector{0},2),
                            &\norm{\vector{x}}_{2}^{n}>t\\
                            \frac{2}{2-t}(\vector{x},t)+
                            (1-\frac{2}{2-t})(\vector{0},2),&
                            \norm{\vector{x}}_{2}^{n}\leq{t}
                        \end{cases}
                    \end{equation}
                    where $\norm{\vector{x}}_{2}^{n}$ denotes the Euclidean norm
                    in $\nspace$, and not some norm raised to the $n^{th}$
                    power. The restriction of $f$ to
                    $(\closure[]{\nball}\times\{0\})\cup(\nsphere[n-1]\times{I})$
                    is the identity. If
                    $(\vector{x},t)\in\closure[]{\nball}\times\{0\}$, then $t=0$
                    and hence
                    $f(\vector{x},t)=f(\vector{x},0)=(\vector{x},0)$. In the
                    latter case we have $\norm{\vector{x}}_{2}^{n}=1$, plugging
                    in to $f$ again yields $f(\vector{x},t)=(\vector{x},t)$. All
                    we need now is to check continuity.
                \end{proof}

                With this we prove that a subcomplex of a CW complex gives rise
                to a pair that has the homotopy extension property.
                \begin{theorem}
                    If $\topspace{X}$ is a CW complex and if $A\subseteq{X}$ is
                    a subcomplex, then there is a retract from
                    $X\times{I}$ to $(X\times\{0\})\cup(A\times{I})$ with the
                    product and subspace topologies, respectively.
                \end{theorem}
                The suspension of wedges need not be too particularly attractive
                even if we start with well behaved spaces. For example, the
                suspension of the wedge of two circles is shown in Fig
                \begin{figure}[H]
                    \centering
                    \captionsetup{type=figure}

                    \label{fig:Suspesnion_of_Wedge}
                \end{figure}
                When we are taking the suspension of topological spaces which
                are themselves CW complexes, and if the points we take the wedge
                over are contained in the zero skeleton of each complex, then we
                make speak of the reduced suspension $\Sigma(X\lor{Y})$. The
                reduced suspension of $X$ is the suspension of $X$ where we
                collapse the portion $\{x\}\times{I}$ to a single point. Now the
                reduced suspension of $\nsphere[1]\lor\nsphere[1]$ is just
                $\nsphere[2]\lor\nsphere[2]$. This phenomenon generalizes and
                the reduced suspension distributes over the wedge product. That
                is, $\Sigma(X\lor{Y})$ is homeomorphic to
                $\Sigma{X}\lor\Sigma{Y}$.
            \subsection{Graphs}
                \begin{fdefinition}{Graph}{Graph}
                    A graph is a one dimensional CW complex.
                \end{fdefinition}
                No connected assumptions are made, nor do we impose that graphs
                be \textit{simple} (no vertex has an edge between itself). We
                wish to simplify the study of graphs by showing they are
                homotopy equivalent to simpler objects. To do this we need a
                nice \textit{contractible} subset of a graph which when
                quotienting out by makes the problem easier. These nice subsets
                are known as \textit{spanning trees}. A cycle in a graph $X$ is
                an injective function $\gamma:\nsphere[1]\rightarrow{X}$. A tree
                is a connected graph containing no cycles. Lastly, a spanning
                tree of a graph $X$ is a tree $T\subseteq{X}$ such that the
                0-skeleton $X^{0}$ is contained in $T$. That is,
                $X^{0}\subseteq{T}$. We present the following theorem without
                proof, which relies on Zorn's lemma.
                \begin{theorem}
                    If $\topspace{X}$ is a connected graph, then there exists
                    $T\subseteq{X}$ such that $T$ is a spanning tree of $X$.
                \end{theorem}
                Next, we show that every tree has a \textit{leaf}, which is an
                element of the zero skeleton $x\in{X}^{0}$ such that at most
                only one element of $X^{1}$ contains $x$ on its boundary. We say
                \textit{at most} since the empty tree, which is just a vertex,
                will have a point with zero edges attached. For non-trivial
                trees a leaf will have one and only one edge. The proof requires
                the following non-trivial statement from point-set topology
                which we will not prove.
                \begin{theorem}
                    If $\topspace{X}$ is a path connected Hausdorff space, then
                    it is arc connected: For all $x,y\in{X}$ there is an
                    \textit{injective} path between $x$ and $y$.
                \end{theorem}
                \begin{proof}
                    Engelking's topology textbook.
                \end{proof}
                The Hausdorff condition is not redundant, the line with two
                origins is path connected but not arc connected. Since CW
                complexes are Hausdorff we may apply this result.
                \begin{theorem}
                    If $X$ is a tree with more than one point, then it has two
                    leaves.
                \end{theorem}
                \begin{proof}
                    We prove by transfinite induction on the 0-skeleton. If
                    there are only two elements, then we are done. Suppose it is
                    true for some ordinal $\omega$ and let $X$ be a tree with
                    $\omega+1$ elements. Pick any point and label it $x$. If
                    this point is a leaf we are done, if not delete it. Since
                    $x$ is not a leaf there are two points $y_{1},y_{2}$
                    connected to it. Hence $y_{1}\mapsto{x}\mapsto{y}_{2}$ is an
                    injective path between $y_{1}$ and $y_{2}$. Now
                    $X\setminus\{x\}$ is disconnected. For suppose not. Then by
                    the previous theorem there is an arc between $y_{1}$ and
                    $y_{2}$ in $X\setminus\{x\}$, label this $\gamma$. But then
                    concatenating $\gamma$ with our original path between
                    $y_{1}$ and $y_{2}$ gives us a cycle, a contradiction since
                    our space is a tree. Hence $X\setminus\{x\}$ is
                    disconnected, consisting of two components, both of which
                    are themselves trees. By the induction hypothesis there are
                    two leaves in each of these subtrees. If $y_{1}$ and $y_{2}$
                    are two of the leaves, gluing them back together results in
                    2 leaves in $X$, and if not then there are 3 or 4 leaves.
                    Either way there are at least two.
                \end{proof}
                \begin{theorem}
                    If $X$ is a tree, then it is contractible.
                \end{theorem}
                \begin{proof}
                    By induction. In the base case of a point there is nothing
                    to prove. Suppose it is true for some ordinal $\omega$ and
                    let $X$ be a tree with $\omega+1$ vertices. But every tree
                    has a leaf, hence there is a leaf $x\in{X}$. Hence there is
                    a $y\in{X}$ with a sincle 1-cell connecting $x$ and $y$. But
                    the closed unit interval is contractible and hence we may
                    contract $x$ to $y$ obtaining a tree with $\omega$ vertices.
                    By the induction hypothesis, we are done.
                \end{proof}
                To conclude we show that if $X$ is a CW complex, and if $A$ is a
                contractible subcomplex, then $X/A$ is homotopy equivalent to
                $X$. First, the main result.
                \begin{ftheorem}{Homotopy Type of Connected Graphs}
                                {Homotopy_Type_of_Connected_Graphs}
                    If $X$ is a connected graph, then it is either homotopy
                    equivalent to a wedge of circles, or it is contractible.
                \end{ftheorem}
                \begin{bproof}
                    For if $X$ is a graph, then there is a spanning tree $T$.
                    But since $T$ contains every vertex, it is thus a closed
                    subspace which is the union of cells, and is therefore a
                    subcomplex. But trees are contractible and hence $X$ is
                    homotopy equivalent to $X/T$. But $T$ contains every vertex
                    and hence $X/T$ consists of a single 0-cell, the equivalence
                    class of $T$. But then $X/T$ is a CW complex consisting of
                    one 0-cell and some cardinality of 1-cells attached to it.
                    But this is precisely the description of a wedge of circles,
                    or a point if there are no 1-cells to attach.
                \end{bproof}
                For disconnected graphs we do this procedure component-wise
                obtaining the disjoint union of such spaces. Now we prove the
                result used to obtain this. If $(X,A)$ is a CW pair, and if $A$
                is contractible, then $X/A$ is homotopy equivalent to $X$. We
                must first know that CW pairs have the homotopy extension
                property.
                \begin{theorem}
                    If $(X,A)$ is a CW pair, then it has the homotopy extension
                    property.
                \end{theorem}
                \begin{proof}
                    First we note that $\ndisk\times{I}$ can be retracted to
                    $(\ndisk\times\{0\})\cup(\partial\ndisk\times{I})$. For
                    example, pick $(\vector{0},2)\in\ndisk\times\mathbb{R}$ and
                    project radial outwards onto this boundary. This is like
                    hollowing out a cylinder to get a cup. This retract $r$
                    gives us a deformation retraction via the straight line
                    homotopy. This further gives us a deformation retraction of
                    $X^{n}\times{I}$ onto
                    $(X^{n}\times\{0\})\cup\big((X^{n-1}\cup{A}^{n})\times{I}\big)$
                    for each $n$. That is, since $X^{n}$ is obtained from
                    $X^{n-1}$ by attaching copies of $\ndisk$ along its boundary
                    to $X^{n-1}$, we have that $X^{n}\times{I}$ is obtained from
                    attaching $\ndisk\times{I}$ along
                    $(\ndisk\times\{0\})\cup\big((^{n-1}\cup{A}^{n})\times{I}\big)$.
                    Performing this retraction for each $n$ between time
                    interval $1/2^{n+1}$ and $1/2^{n}$ gives us a final
                    deformation retraction of $X\times{I}$ to
                    $(X\times\{0\})\cup(A\times{I})$. This concatenation is
                    continuous at $t=0$ since $X^{n}\times{I}$ is stationary for
                    $t<1/2^{n+1}$ and hence the restriction to $X^{n}$ is
                    continuous. Since this restriction is continuous for every
                    skeleton, the map is continuous in the weak CW topology.
                \end{proof}
                \begin{theorem}
                    If $X$ is a CW complex and if $A\subseteq{X}$ is a
                    contractible subcomplex, then $X/A$ is homotopy equivalent
                    to $X$.
                \end{theorem}
                \begin{proof}
                    Since $A$ is a subcomplex, $(X,A)$ is a CW pair, and
                    therefore $(X,A)$ has the homotopy extension property. By
                    hypothesis $A$ is contractible, hence there is a contraction
                    $H:A\times{I}\rightarrow{A}$ from the identity
                    $\identity{A}$ to a constant map. But $\identity{A}$ extends
                    to $\identity{X}$ continuously since $A\subseteq{X}$ and
                    by the homotopy extension property $H$ extension to a
                    homotopy $F:X\times{I}\rightarrow{X}$ such that
                    $F|_{A\times{I}}=H$. Let $q:X\rightarrow{X}/A$ be the
                    canonical quotient map. But $F(a,t)\in{A}$ for all $a\in{A}$
                    and $t\in{I}$, and hence $q(F(a,t))=const$ since $A$ maps to
                    a single equivalence class under $q$. Let
                    $\tilde{F}:(X/A)\times{I}\rightarrow{X}/A$ be defined by:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \tilde{F}([x],t)=q\big(F(x,t)\big)
                    \end{equation}
                    By the previous statement this is well defined and
                    independent of representative. Define $g:X/A\rightarrow{X}$
                    by:
                    \begin{equation}
                        g([x])=F(x,1)
                    \end{equation}
                    This is well defined since at $t=1$, $F(a,1)=const$ for all
                    $a\in{A}$, and for $x\notin{A}$ the equivalence class of $x$
                    is just $\{x\}$. But then $F$ is a homotopy between
                    $g\circ{q}$ and $\identity{X}$ and $\tilde{F}$ is a homotopy
                    between $q\circ{g}$ and $\identity{A}$. Hence $q$ and $g$
                    are homotopy inverses of each other and are therefore
                    homotopy equivalences.
                \end{proof}
        \section{Problems}
        \begin{problem}
            Construct an explicit deformation retraction of
            $\nspace\setminus\{\vector{0}\}$ to $\nsphere[n-1]$.
        \end{problem}
        \begin{solution}
            Let $X=\nspace\setminus\{\vector{0}\}$ and define $r:X\rightarrow{X}$
            by:
            \begin{equation}
                r(\vector{x})=\frac{\vector{x}}{\norm{\vector{x}}_{2}}
            \end{equation}
            This is well defined since for all $\vector{x}\in{X}$ we have
            $\vector{x}\ne\vector{0}$ and hence $\norm{\vector{x}}_{2}\ne{0}$.
            Moreover, it is a retract of $X$ to $\nsphere[n-1]$. For if
            $\vector{s}\in\nsphere[n-1]$ then by definition
            $\norm{\vector{s}}_{2}=1$. But then:
            \begin{equation}
                r(\vector{s})=\frac{\vector{s}}{\norm{\vector{s}}_{2}}
                    =\vector{s}
                    =\identity{\nsphere[n-1]}(\vector{s})
            \end{equation}
            Hence $r|_{\nsphere[n-1]}=\identity{\nsphere[n-1]}$. Moreover, the
            image of $r$ is $\nsphere[n-1]$ since:
            \begin{equation}
                \norm{r(\vector{x})}_{2}
                    =\norm[\bigg]{\frac{\vector{x}}{\norm{\vector{x}}_{2}}}_{2}
                    =\frac{\norm{\vector{x}}_{2}}{\norm{\vector{x}}_{2}}
                    =1
            \end{equation}
            Therefore $r$ satisfies the criterion of a retract. Let
            $H:X\times{I}\rightarrow{X}$ be the straight-line homotopy:
            \begin{equation}
                H(\vector{x},\,t)
                    =(1-t)\cdot\identity{X}(\vector{x})+t\cdot{r}(\vector{x})
            \end{equation}
            This is well defined since for all $\vector{x}\in{X}$ and $t\in[0,1]$
            we have:
            \begin{subequations}
                \begin{align}
                    \norm{H(\vector{x},\,t)}_{2}&=
                    \norm{(1-t)\cdot\vector{x}+t\cdot{r}(\vector{x})}_{2}\\
                    &\geq\min\{\norm{\vector{x}}_{2},\,\norm{r(\vector{x})}_{2}\}\\
                    &>0
                \end{align}
            \end{subequations}
            Intuitively, $H(\vector{x},t)$ is the straight line from
            $\vector{x}$ to $r(\vector{x})$ and this never crosses the origin.
            Hence, $H(\vector{x},t)$ is well defined and moreover is a homotopy
            between the identity map and $r$. It is a deformation retraction since
            for all $\vector{s}\in\nspace[n-1]$ and $t\in[0,1]$ we have:
            \begin{equation}
                H(\vector{s},\,t)=(1-t)\cdot{t}+t\cdot\vector{s}=\vector{s}
            \end{equation}
        \end{solution}
        \begin{problem}
            A deformation retraction in the weak sense of a space $X$ to a subspace
            $A$ is a homotopy $H:X\times{I}\rightarrow{X}$ between $\identity{X}$
            and a function $g:X\rightarrow{X}$ such that $g[X]\subseteq{A}$ and
            such that for all $t\in[0,1]$ and $a\in{A}$, $H(a,t)\in{A}$. Show that
            if $X$ deformation retracts to $A$ in the weak sense, then the
            inclusion mapping $\iota:A\rightarrow{X}$ is a homotopy equivalence.
        \end{problem}
        \begin{solution}
            We need to find a homotopy inverse $g:X\rightarrow{A}$ of
            $\iota:A\rightarrow{X}$. That is, a function $g$ such that
            $g\circ\iota$ is homotopic to $\identity{A}$ and $\iota\circ{g}$ is
            homotopic to $\identity{X}$. Let $g:X\rightarrow{A}$ be the function
            the homotopy $H$ drags $\identity{X}$ to. That is, $g(x)=H(x,1)$.
            Then $(g\circ\iota)(a)=g(a)$ for all $a\in{A}$. But then
            $H|_{A\times{I}}$ is a homotopy between $g\circ\iota$ and
            $\identity{A}$. That is, $H|_{A\times{I}}:A\times{I}\rightarrow{A}$ is
            a continuous function, the image is in $A$ since by hypothesis for all
            $a\in{A}$ and $t\in{I}$, $H(a,t)\in{A}$, and lastly:
            \begin{equation}
                H(a,\,0)=\identity{X}(a)=a=\identity{A}(a)
            \end{equation}
            and also $H(a,\,1)=g(a)$. Similarly, since the image of $g$ lies in $A$,
            $\iota\circ{g}=g$ and hence $H$ is a homotopy between
            $\iota\circ{g}$ and $\identity{X}$. Thus, $g$ is a homotopy inverse of
            $\iota$ and hence $\iota$ is a homotopy equivalence.
        \end{solution}
        Before the next problem, we prove the following theorem to make life easier.
        \begin{theorem}
            If $\topspace{X}$ is a topological space, then it is
            contractible if and only if $\identity{X}$ is nullhomotopic.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            If $\topspace{X}$ is contractible, then there is a homotopy
            equivalence $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ where $Y=\{0\}$ is the
            one point space. But if $f$ is a homotopy equivalence, then
            there is a homotopy inverse $g:Y\rightarrow{X}$. But then
            $g\circ{f}$ is homotopic to $\identity{X}$. But $Y$ has only
            one point, and hence $f(x)=0$ for all $x\in{X}$. Let
            $x_{0}=g(0)$. Then $g\circ{f}:X\rightarrow{X}$ is the
            mapping $x\mapsto{x}_{0}$. But $\identity{X}$ is homotopic
            to this, and is therefore nullhomotopic. In the other
            direction, if $\identity{X}$ is nullhomotopic, then there is
            a point $x_{0}\in{X}$ such that $\identity{X}$ is homotopic
            to the function $f:X\rightarrow{X}$ defined by $f(x)=x_{0}$.
            Let $Y=\{x_{0}\}$ be given the subspace topology. Since
            there is only one topology on a space with one point, this
            is homeomorphic to the one point space. But then $f$ is a
            homotopy equivalence since the function $g:Y\rightarrow{X}$
            given by $g(x_{0})=x_{0}$ is a homotopy inverse of $f$. That
            is, since $\identity{X}$ is homotopic to $f$,
            $g\circ{f}$ is homotopic to $\identity{X}$ since
            $g\circ{f}=f$. But also $f\circ{g}=\identity{Y}$. Hence $f$
            is an homotopy equivalence and $\topspace{X}$ is
            contractible.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{problem}
            Show that a retract of a contracible space is contracible.
        \end{problem}
        \begin{solution}
            For $\topspace{X}$ is contractible if and only if
            $\identity{X}$ is nullhomotopic. That is, there is a point
            $x_{0}\in{X}$ such that $\identity{X}$ is homotopic to the
            function $g:X\rightarrow{X}$ defined by $g(x)=x_{0}$. Let $H$ be such a
            homotopy. But if $f:X\rightarrow{A}$ is a retract, then
            $f|_{A}=\identity{A}$. Hence $f\circ{H}|_{A\times{I}}$ is a
            homotopy between $\identity{A}$ and $f(x_{0})$. That is,
            $f\circ{H}|_{A\times{I}}$ is the composition of continuous functions and
            is therefore continuous. Moreover,
            \begin{subequations}
                \begin{align}
                    (f\circ{H}|_{A\times{I}})(a,0)=f\big(H|_{A\times{I}}(a,0)\big)
                        =f\big(\identity{X}(a)\big)
                        =f(a)
                        =a
                \end{align}
            \end{subequations}
            But also:
            \begin{equation}
                (f\circ{H}|_{A\times{I}})(a,1)=f\big(H|_{A\times{I}}(a,1)\big)
                    =f\big(g(a)\big)
                    =f(x_{0})
            \end{equation}
            Therefore $\identity{A}$ is nullhomotopic and $A$ is contracible.
        \end{solution}
        \begin{problem}
            Show that every mapping cylinder for any continuous function
            $f:\nsphere[1]\rightarrow\nsphere[1]$ is a CW complex. Construct a
            CW complex that has the annulus and M\"{o}bius band as deformation
            retracts.
        \end{problem}
        \begin{solution}
            We start with two points in our 0-cell and then attach three 1-cells.
            We wrap two copies of $(0,1)$ around in circles about the two points,
            and the final one connects the two points. Hence we have two copies of
            $\nsphere[1]$ and one copy of $[0,1]$. From here we glue the square
            $[0,1]\times[0,1]$ into this by mapping $(x,1)$ to $\exp(2\pi{i}x)$ in
            the top circle, $(0,y)$ and $(1,y)$ to the closed interval part of our
            $X^{1}$ skeleton. Lastly we attach $(x,0)$ to $f(\exp(2\pi{i}x))$ in
            the bottom circle. The result is a mapping cylinder for $f$ consisting
            of two 0-cells, three 1-cells, and one 2-cell.
            \par\hfill\par
            As noted in Hatcher's text, both the annulus and the M\"{o}bius strip
            can be deformation retracted to a circle by means of a mapping cylinder.
            We use the above assertion to construct a CW complex that contains the
            annulus and a M\"{o}bius strip as retracts
            (Fig.~\ref{fig:CW_Comp_Annulus_Mobius}). We start with an actual
            cylinder obtained from the mapping cylinder of the function
            $\identity{\nsphere[1]}$. The result is homeomorphic to an annulus. We
            then use the M\"{o}bius band function
            $f:\nsphere[1]\rightarrow\nsphere[1]$ to obtain the M\"{o}bius strip as
            the mapping cylinder $M_{f}$. We glue the bottom of the mapping cylinder
            of the identity map to the top of the mapping cylinder of the M\"{o}bius
            strip. The result is a CW complex with three 0-cells, five 1-cells, and
            two 2-cells. To deformation retract to the annulus we first use the
            mapping cylinder of the M\"{o}bius band and squeeze this down, leaving
            the annulus untouched. Easier to visualize, to obtain the M\"{o}bius
            band we simply push the cylinder part of
            Fig.~\ref{fig:CW_Comp_Annulus_Mobius} down, leaving the M\"{o}bius band
            untouched.

        \begin{problem}
            Show that a homotopy equivalence $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ induces a bijection
            between the set of path-components of $X$ and the set of path-components
            of $Y$. Show that $f$ restricts to a homotopy equivalence between each
            path-component. Prove this statement for components.
        \end{problem}
        \begin{solution}
            For let $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ be a homotopy equivalence and
            $\mathcal{U}\subseteq{X}$ a path connected component. Let
            $x\in\mathcal{U}$ be arbitrary, let $y=f(x)$, and let $\mathcal{V}$ be
            the path connected component of $Y$ containing $y$. Let
            $\mathcal{U}\mapsto_{f}\mathcal{V}$. We must show this is well-defined
            and bijective. Since the continuous image of a path connected space is
            path connected, and since homotopy equivalences are continuous, for any
            point $p\in\mathcal{U}$ we have $f(p)\in\mathcal{V}$. That is, since
            $\mathcal{U}$ is hypothesized to be path connected, and since $x$ and
            $p$ are contained in $\mathcal{U}$, there is a path between $p$ and $x$.
            Composing this path with $f$ results in a path between $f(x)$ and
            $f(p)$. Since $\mathcal{V}$ is a path connected component we may
            conclude $f(p)\in\mathcal{V}$. Hence $\mathcal{U}$ maps to $\mathcal{V}$
            regardless of representative, and therefore this map is well defined.
            Moreover, it is injective. If
            $\mathcal{U}_{1}$ and $\mathcal{U}_{2}$ map to the same $\mathcal{V}$
            then $\mathcal{U}_{1}=\mathcal{U}_{2}$. For if $f$ is a homotopy
            equivalence, then there is a homotopy inverse $g:Y\rightarrow{X}$ such
            that $g\circ{f}$ is homotopic to $\identity{X}$. Let
            $x_{1}\in\mathcal{U}_{1}$ and $x_{2}\in\mathcal{U}_{2}$ and define
            $y_{1}=f(x_{1})$ and $y_{2}=f(x_{2})$. Since $y_{1},y_{2}\in\mathcal{V}$
            and $\mathcal{V}$ is path connected, there is a path $\gamma$ between
            $y_{1}$ and $y_{2}$. Let $\Gamma=g\circ\gamma$. Since $g$ is continuous,
            this is a path in $X$. Moreover, it is a path between $g(y_{1})$ and
            $g(y_{2})$. But $g\circ{f}$ is homotopic to $\identity{X}$
            and hence there is a homotopy $H_{X}:X\times{I}\rightarrow{X}$ such that
            $H_{X}(x,0)=(g\circ{f})(x)$ and $H_{X}(x,1)=x$. But then
            $H_{X}(x_{1},t)$ is a path between $g(y_{1})$ and $x_{1}$ and
            $H_{X}(x_{2},t)$ is a path between $g(y_{2})$ and $x_{2}$. But there is
            a path between $g(y_{1})$ and $g(y_{2})$, namely $\Gamma$, and hence by
            concatenating there is a path between $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$. Thus,
            $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ reside in the same path connected component and
            hence $\mathcal{U}_{1}=\mathcal{U}_{2}$. By an identical argument,
            $\mathcal{V}\mapsto_{g}\mathcal{U}$ is an injective function from the
            path connected components of $Y$ to the path connected components of
            $X$. But then there exist injective functions in both directions, so by
            the Cantor-Schr\"{o}eder-Bernstein theorem there is a bijection. That
            is, there exists a bijection between the path connected components
            of $X$ and the path connected components of $Y$. Now, given a path
            component $\mathcal{U}\subseteq{X}$, $f|_{\mathcal{U}}$ is a homotopy
            equivalence to it's corresponding path connected component
            $\mathcal{V}\subseteq{Y}$. Consider $g|_{\mathcal{V}}$. Given the
            homotopy $H_{X}:X\times{I}\rightarrow{X}$, let $G_{X}$ be it's
            restriction to $\mathcal{U}\times{I}$. Then $G$ is a homotopy
            equivalence between $g|_{\mathcal{V}}\circ{f}|_{\mathcal{U}}$ and
            $\identity{\mathcal{U}}$. Firstly, the image of $G$ resides in
            $\mathcal{U}$ since for all $x\in\mathcal{U}$, $G(x,t)$ is a path
            between $H(x,0)=g(f(x))$ and $H(x,1)=x$, both of which reside in
            $\mathcal{U}$ and since $\mathcal{U}$ is path connected this implies the
            entire image of $G$ resides in $\mathcal{U}$. But then
            $G(x,0)=(g|_{\mathcal{V}}\circ{f}|_{\mathcal{U}})(x)$ and $G(x,1)=x$.
            Hence $G$ is a homotopy between $g|_{\mathcal{V}}\circ{f}_{\mathcal{U}}$
            and $\identity{\mathcal{U}}$. Similarly, since $g$ is a homotopy inverse
            of $g$, $f\circ{g}$ is homotopic to $\identity{Y}$. Let
            $H_{Y}:Y\times{I}\rightarrow{Y}$ be such a homotopy and
            $G_{Y}=H_{Y}|_{\mathcal{V}\times{I}}$. By an identical argument $G_{Y}$
            is a homotopy between $f|_{\mathcal{U}}\circ{g}|_{\mathcal{V}}$ and
            $\identity{\mathcal{V}}$. Hence $g|_{\mathcal{V}}$ is a homotopy inverse
            of $f|_{\mathcal{U}}$, so $f|_{\mathcal{U}}$ is a homotopy equivalence.
            For connected components, let $\mathcal{U}\mapsto_{f}\mathcal{V}$ be a
            similar mapping. Given $x\in\mathcal{U}$, let $\mathcal{V}\subseteq{Y}$
            be the connected component containing $f(x)$. We must show this is well
            defined. But the continuous image of connected is still connected, and
            hence if $p\in\mathcal{U}$, then $f(p)\in\mathcal{V}$ and therefore
            $\mathcal{U}$ maps unambiguously to $\mathcal{V}$. We must show this
            mapping is injective. Let $\mathcal{U}_{1},\mathcal{U}_{2}\subseteq{X}$
            be connected components and suppose both map to $\mathcal{V}$. But since
            $f$ is a homotopy equivalence there is a homotopy inverse
            $g:Y\rightarrow{X}$ such that $g\circ{f}$ is homotopic to $\identity{X}$
            and $f\circ{g}$ is homotopic to $\identity{Y}$. But then there is a path
            between $x_{1}$ and $(g\circ{f})(x_{1})$ and similarly for $x_{2}$. But
            path connected components are contained within connected components, and
            hence these paths reside in $\mathcal{U}_{1}$ and $\mathcal{U}_{2}$,
            respectively. But $\mathcal{V}$ is connected and $g$ is continuous, and
            therefore $g[\mathcal{V}]$ is connected. Since
            $g(f(x_{1}))\in\mathcal{U}_{1}$ we conclude
            $g[\mathcal{V}]\subseteq\mathcal{U}_{1}$. Similarly, since
            $g(f(x_{2}))\in\mathcal{U}_{2}$, we conclude
            $g[\mathcal{V}]\subseteq\mathcal{U}_{2}$. But then $\mathcal{U}_{1}$ and
            $\mathcal{U}_{2}$ have non-empty intersection. Since they are connected
            components we thus have $\mathcal{U}_{1}=\mathcal{U}_{2}$. Similarly,
            since $f$ is a homotopy inverse of $g$, the mapping
            $\mathcal{V}\mapsto_{g}\mathcal{U}$ unambiguously and injectively maps 
            connected components of $Y$ to connected components of $X$. Invoking
            Cantor-Schr\"{o}eder-Bernstein we thus obtain a bijection. Given
            a connected component $\mathcal{U}\subseteq{X}$, $f|_{\mathcal{U}}$ is a
            homotopy equivalence into the corresponding $\mathcal{V}\subseteq{Y}$
            since $g|_{\mathcal{V}}$ is a homotopy inverse. For $g\circ{f}$ is
            homotopy equivalent to $\identity{X}$ and hence there is a homotopy
            $H_{X}:X\times{I}\rightarrow{X}$ such that
            $H(x,0)=(g\circ{f})(x)$ and $H(x,1)=x$. But then
            $G_{X}=H_{X}|_{\mathcal{U}\times{I}}$ is a homotopy between
            $g|_{\mathcal{V}}\circ{f}|_{\mathcal{U}}$ and $\identity{\mathcal{U}}$.
            Firstly, the image of $G_{X}$ resides in $\mathcal{U}$. For any
            $x\in\mathcal{U}$, $G_{X}(x,t)$ is a path between
            $(g\circ{f})(x)$ and $x$. Since $\mathcal{U}$ is connected, the entirety
            of this path lies in $\mathcal{U}$. But
            $G_{X}(x,0)=H_{X}(x,0)=(g|_{\mathcal{V}}\circ{f}|_{\mathcal{U}})(x)$
            and $G_{X}(x,1)=H_{X}(x,1)=x$. That is, $G_{X}$ is a homotopy between
            $g|_{\mathcal{V}}\circ{f}|_{\mathcal{U}}$ and $\identity{\mathcal{U}}$.
            By a similar argument, $f|_{\mathcal{U}}\circ{g}|_{\mathcal{V}}$ is
            homotopic to $\identity{\mathcal{V}}$. If $X$ is such that the path
            connected components coincide with the connected components, and
            $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ is a homotopy equivalence, then the same is true for
            $Y$. Given a connected component $\mathcal{V}\subseteq{Y}$, let
            $\mathcal{U}$ be the corresponding connected component in $X$. But by
            hypothesis $\mathcal{U}$ is path connected. Let
            $y_{1},y_{2}\in\mathcal{V}$, $x_{1}=g(y_{1})$, and $x_{2}=g(y_{2})$.
            Since $X$ is path connected, there is path $\gamma$ between $x_{1}$ and
            $x_{2}$. But then $f\circ\gamma$ is a path between $f(x_{1})$ and
            $f(x_{2})$. But $f\circ{g}$ is homotopic to $\identity{Y}$, so let
            $H_{Y}$ be such a homotopy. But then $H_{Y}(y_{1},t)$ is a path between
            $y_{1}$ and $f(x_{1})$, and similarly for $y_{2}$. But $f\circ\gamma$
            is a path from $f(x_{1})$ to $f(x_{2})$. By concatenating paths we
            obtain a path from $y_{1}$ to $y_{2}$. Hence, $\mathcal{V}$ is path
            connected and the connected components of $Y$ coincide with the path
            connected ones.
        \end{solution}
        \begin{problem}
            Show that $\nsphere[m]*\nsphere$ is homeomorphic to $\nsphere[m+n+1]$.
        \end{problem}
        \begin{solution}
            Define
            $f:\nsphere[m]\times\nsphere[n]\rightarrow{I}\rightarrow\nsphere[n+m+1]$
            as follows:
            \begin{equation}
                f\big(\vector{a},\vector{b},t\big)
                =\big(\sqrt{1-t}\cdot\vector{a},\sqrt{t}\cdot\vector{b}\big)
            \end{equation}
            The image of $f$ lies in $\nsphere[n+m+1]$ since if
            $\vector{a}\in\nsphere[m]$ and $\vector{b}\in\nsphere[m]$, then
            $\norm{\vector{a}}=\norm{\vector{b}}=1$. From orthogonality of the
            components we then obtain:
            \begin{equation}
                \norm{f(\vector{a},\vector{b},t)}^{2}
                    =(1-t)\norm{\vector{a}}^{2}+t\norm{\vector{b}}^{2}=1
            \end{equation}
            Then $f$ is surjective. We then pass $f$ to the quotient obtaining
            $\tilde{f}$. This is well defined since the following equation:
            \begin{equation}
                f(\vector{a}_{1},\vector{b}_{1},t_{1})
                    =f(\vector{a}_{2},\vector{b}_{2},t_{2})
            \end{equation}
            is true if and only if both $t_{1}$ and $t_{2}$ are either zero or one
            and the corresponding $\vector{a}_{i}$ match the $\vector{b}_{j}$, or if
            all of the components match. But in this former instance the points are
            identified by the equivalence relation and hence belong to the same
            equivalence class. Hence the function obtained from
            passing to the quotient is well defined, and moreover this argument
            shows it is bijective. That is, $f$ is surjective, and hence so is
            $\tilde{f}$, and from the previous argument $\tilde{f}$ is injective.
            Since $f$ is continuous, so is $\tilde{f}$, and hence we have a
            continuous bijection from $\nsphere[m]*\nsphere$ into $\nsphere[n+m+1]$.
            But the join of compact sets is the quotient of the product of compact
            sets, which is thus the quotient of a compact space, and is therefore
            compact. Also, $\nsphere[n+m+1]$ is Hausdorff, so $\tilde{f}$ is a
            continuous bijection from a compact space to a Hausdorff one, and is
            therefore a homeomorphism.
        \end{solution}
        \begin{problem}
            Show that the space obtained from $\nsphere[2]$ by attaching any $n$
            2-cells along any collection of $n$ circles is homotopy equivalence to
            the wedge sum of $n+1$ copies of $\nsphere[2]$.
        \end{problem}
        \begin{solution}
            We prove by induction on $n$. First we note that $\nsphere[2]$ is
            simply connected. That is, any continuous function
            $f:\nsphere[1]\rightarrow\nsphere[2]$ is homotopic to a constant map.
            Since we are only dealing with circles, we need only prove this for the
            case of $f$ being injective. We use stereographic projection, and the
            fact that $\nsphere[1]$ is not homeomorphic to $\nsphere[2]$. This can
            be seen since they have different dimensions, but neglecting manifold
            theory this can also be seen since removing two points from
            $\nsphere[1]$ results in a disconnected space, whereas removing any
            finite number of points from
            $\nsphere[2]$ does not disconnect the sphere. So any continuous
            injective mapping $f:\nsphere[1]\rightarrow\nsphere[2]$ is not
            surjective, for otherwise $f$ would be a homeomorphism. That is, a
            continuous bijection from a compact space to a Hausdorff one is a
            homeomorphism, $\nsphere[1]$ is compact, and $\nsphere[2]$ is Hausdorff.
            So if $\nsphere[1]$ maps into $\nsphere[2]$ injectively and
            continuously, then the mapping is not surjective. Hence
            $\nsphere[2]\setminus{f}[\nsphere[1]]$ is non-empty. Moreover, this
            subset is open since $f[\nsphere[1]]$ is compact, and hence closed.
            Given a point in the complement we may find a small open neighborhood of
            this point such that $f[\nsphere[1]]$ does not intersect its closure.
            Removing this open subset results in a space that is homeomorphic to
            $\nspace[2]$, which is contractible. Hence any continuous function is
            homotopic to a constant. Pulling back all of this to the sphere shows
            that $\nsphere[2]$ is simply connected. Hence if we attach a 2-cell
            along a circle within the sphere, we may contract this circle to a point
            and obtain a sphere with a 2-cell attached to a point on the sphere.
            But this is precisely the wedge of $\nsphere[2]$ with $\nsphere[2]$.
            That is, our original space is homotopy equivalent to
            $\nsphere[2]\lor\nsphere[2]$. Suppose this is true of $n$ circles.
            Since the wedge of path connected spaces is equivalent up to homotopy
            regardless of choice of points, we may choose the wedge of $n$ spheres
            to all be at the same point. Given a circle in the original sphere and a
            2-cell attached to this we may then contract the circle down to our
            common point, obtaining another sphere. The result is the wedge of $n+1$
            spheres.
        \end{solution}
        \begin{problem}
            Show that if $(X,A)$ has the homotopy extension property, then
            $X\times{I}$ deformation retracts to $X\times\{0\}\cup{A}\times{I}$.
        \end{problem}
        \begin{solution}
            For if $(X,A)$ satisfies the homotopy extension property, then there is
            a retract of $X\times{I}$ to $X\times\{0\}\cup{A}\times{I}$. But then
            the inclusion map
            $\iota:X\times\{0\}\cup{A}\times{I}\rightarrow{X}\times{I}$ is a
            homotopy equivalence. For let $r$ be the retract. Then
            $r\circ\iota$ is just the identity map on $X\times\{0\}\cup{A}\times{I}$
            since $r$ is a retract, and the identity is homotopic to itself. But
            since $\iota\circ{r}$ is just the restriction of $r$ to
            $X\times\{0\}\cup{A}\times{I}$ we may use the homotopy extension
            property to extend $f_{0}=\identity{X}$ and $f_{1}=r$ to a homotopy,
            showing that $\iota\circ{r}$ is homotopic to the identity map on $X$.
            Hence, the inclusion map is a homotopy equivalence. Then by the
            corollary there is a deformation retraction of $X\times{I}$ onto
            $X\times\{0\}\cup{A}\times{I}$. For the generalization of 0.18, let
            $H:A\times{I}\rightarrow{X}_{0}$ between a homotopy from $f$ to $g$, and
            consider the attaching space $X_{0}\coprod_{H}(X_{1}\times{I})$. But
            since $(X_{1},A)$ has the homotopy extension property, there is a
            deformation retraction of $X_{1}\times{I}$ to
            $X_{1}\times\{0\}\cup{A}\times{I}$, and this induces a deformation
            retraction of $X_{0}\coprod_{H}(X_{1}\times{I})$ to
            $X_{0}\coprod_{f}X_{1}$ and similarly for $g$. Since both of these
            deformation retractions are the identity on $X_{0}$, we see that
            $X_{0}\coprod_{f}X_{1}$ is homotopy equivalent to
            $X_{0}\coprod_{g}X_{1}$ relative to $X_{0}$.
        \end{solution}
        \section{Wrong problems... Woops}
        \begin{problem}
            Show that the free product of non-trivial groups $G$ and $H$ has trivial
            center and that the only elements of finite order are the conjugates
            of finite order elements in $G$ and $H$.
        \end{problem}
        \begin{solution}
            For let $C\subseteq{G}*H$ be the center and suppose $C$ is non-trivial.
            Then there is an element $a\in{C}$ that is not the identity. That is,
            $a$ is not the empty word. Suppose $a$ is in reduced form and let
            $b_{1}$ be the first element and $b_{2}$ be the last,
            $a=b_{1}\cdots{b}_{2}$. If
            $b_{1},b_{2}\in{G}$, let $d\in{H}$ be an element other than the
            identity. Since $H$ is hypothesized to be non-trivial, such an element
            exists. But then $db_{1}$ cannot be reduced since $d\in{H}$ and
            $b_{1}\in{G}$. Similarly, $b_{2}d$ cannot be reduced. But
            $hb_{1}\cdots{b}_{2}$ and $b_{1}\cdots{b}_{2}h$ are distinct words, and
            thus $a$ is not in the center. For similar reasons, it is not possible
            that $b_{1},b_{2}\in{H}$. Thus, suppose $b_{1}\in{G}$ and $b_{2}\in{H}$
            and let $d=b_{1}$. Then $b_{2}d$ cannot be reduced, and $db_{1}$ may or
            may not be able to be reduced. If it cannot, then $da\ne{ad}$. If it can
            then we note that since $a$ is in reduced form it is an alternating
            sequence of elements in $G$ and $H$. Hence, after reducing $db_{1}$ we
            would have $db_{1}h_{1}g_{1}\cdots{b}_{2}$, which cannot be reduced
            further. Moreover, this is not equal to $ad$. Hence, the center is
            trivial. Next, given a word that is a conjugate of elements of finite
            order, it too has finite order. Since
            $(g^{\minus{1}}hg)^{n}=g^{\minus{1}}h^{n}g$, given the order $n$ of the
            element $h$, we would have $(g^{\minus{1}}hg)^{n}=g^{\minus{1}}h^{n}g$
            which simplifies to $g^{\minus{1}}e_{h}g=g^{\minus{1}}g=e_{g}$,
            which is equivalent to the empty word.
        \end{solution}
        \begin{problem}
            Show that $\nspace$ minus finitely many points is simply connected for
            $n\geq{3}$.
        \end{problem}
        \begin{solution}
            For $n\geq{2}$, $\nspace$ with finitely many points removed is a
            connected open subset of $\nspace$. Since $\nspace$ is locally path
            connected, this implies that $\nspace$ without finitely many points is
            path connected for $n\geq{2}$. Suppose first that we remove a single
            point from $\nspace$, $n\geq{3}$. Up to homeomorphism we may as well
            choose the origin, so let $X=\nspace\setminus\{\vector{0}\}$. Since
            $\gamma:\nsphere[1]\rightarrow{X}$ is a  continuous function from a
            compact set, its image is compact. But then there is a closed
            $\varepsilon>0$ ball around $\vector{0}$ that is disjoint with the image
            of $\gamma$. Using this we may project the image of $\gamma$ onto the
            $n-1$ sphere $\nsphere[n-1]$ using the following homotopy:
            \begin{equation}
                H(\theta,t)=(1-t)\cdot\gamma(\theta)
                    +t\cdot\frac{\gamma(\theta)}{\norm{\gamma(\theta)}}
            \end{equation}
            Hence $\gamma$ is homotopic to a loop on $\nsphere[n-1]$. But for
            $k\geq{2}$ $\nsphere[k]$ is simply connected, and hence for
            $n\geq{3}$ we have that $\nsphere[n-1]$ is simply connected. Hence
            this loop is homotopic to a point on $\nsphere[n-1]$. Since
            $X$ is path connected, for any point $\vector{x}_{0}\in{X}$ the
            fundamental groups are isomorphic. This shows that, regardless of base
            point, the fundamental group is trivial. Therefore,
            $\nspace\setminus\{\vector{0}\}$ is simply connected. Now, for $m$
            points removed we may assume they are located at the coordinates
            $(k,0,\dots,0)$ for $k=0,\dots,m-1$. Placing spheres of radius
            $\frac{1}{2}$ around each of these we note that this is just the
            wedge of $\nsphere[n-1]$ $m$ times. Moreover, $\nspace$ with these $m$
            points removed deformation retracts down to this. Following a given
            loop $\gamma$ along this retraction gives us a loop on the wedge of
            $m$ spheres. We may deform the part of the loop in the last sphere
            (the sphere centered at $(m,0,\dots,0)$) to the point of intersection
            with the $m-1$ sphere since $\nsphere[n-1]$ is simply connected for
            $n\geq{3}$. But then the last point no longer affects our loop, and we
            essentially have a loop on the wedge of $m-1$ spheres. By induction,
            this is simply connected.
        \end{solution}
    \section{Correct Problems}
        \begin{problem}
            Show that the composition of paths satisfies the following cancellation
            property. If $f_{0}\cdot{g}_{0}$ is homotopic to $f_{1}\cdot{g}_{1}$,
            and if $g_{0}$ is homotopic to $g_{1}$, then $f_{0}$ is homotopic to
            $f_{1}$.
        \end{problem}
        \begin{solution}
            This is true of any group. Given $a,b,c\in{G}$, $a*c=b*c$, we may
            multiply on the right by $c^{\minus{1}}$ obtaining
            $(a*c)*c^{\minus{1}}=(b*c)*c^{\minus{1}}$. Using associativity we have
            $a*(c*c^{\minus{1}})=a*e=a$ and similarly $b*(c*c^{\minus{1}})=b*e=b$.
            Since the equivalence class of paths is associative under concatenation
            we may adapt this argument. Given that $g_{0}$ is homotopic to $g_{1}$,
            there is a homotopy $H$. But then $H$  also gives us a homotopy between
            $g_{0}\cdot{g}_{0}^{\minus{1}}$ and $g_{1}\cdot{g}_{1}^{\minus{1}}$.
            Explicitly, let $G$ be defined by:
            \begin{equation}
                G(x,t)=
                \begin{cases}
                    H(x,2t),&0\leq{t}\leq\frac{1}{2}\\
                    H(x,2-2t),&\frac{1}{2}\leq{t}\leq{1}
                \end{cases}
            \end{equation}
            Since homotopic is transitive, we have
            $f_{0}\cdot(g_{0}\cdot{g_{0}}^{\minus{1}})$ is homotopic to
            $f_{1}\cdot(g_{1}\cdot{g}_{1}^{\minus{1}})$. But both of these
            concatenations on the right are homotopic to a point, and hence
            $f_{0}$ is homotopic to $f_{1}$.
        \end{solution}
        \begin{problem}
            Show that the change of basis homomorphism $\beta_{h}$ depends only on
            the homotopy class of $h$.
        \end{problem}
        \begin{solution}
            For suppose $g$ and $h$ are paths from $x_{0}$ and $x_{1}$ and that $g$
            is homotopic to $h$. Let $H$ be such a homotopy, $H(t,0)=g(t)$ and
            $H(t,1)=h(t)$. Then for any loop $f$ at $x_{1}$ we have that $g\cdot{f}$
            is homotopic to $h\cdot{f}$. Indeed, let $G(t)$ be defined by $H(2t)$
            for $t\in[0,\frac{1}{2}]$ and $f(t)$ otherwise. This is a continuous
            homotopy between $h\cdot{f}$ and
            $g\cdot{f}$. Similarly, $f\cdot\overline{h}$ and $f\cdot\overline{g}$
            are homotopic, further implying that $h\cdot{f}\cdot\overline{h}$ and
            $g\cdot{f}\cdot\overline{g}$ are homotopic. Hence:
            \begin{equation}
                \beta_{h}([f])=[h\cdot{f}\cdot\overline{h}]
                    =[g\cdot{f}\cdot\overline{g}]=\beta_{g}([f])
            \end{equation}
        \end{solution}
        \begin{problem}
            Show that $\pi_{1}(X)$ is Abelian for a path connected $X$ if and only
            if every change of basepoint homomorphism $\beta_{h}$ depends only on
            the endpoint.
        \end{problem}
        \begin{solution}
            For let $x,y$ be points and $\gamma_{1},\gamma_{2}$ paths taking $x$ to
            $y$. Since $\pi_{1}(X,x)$ is Abelian, so is $\pi_{1}(X,y)$. But then
            given any loop $f$ at $y$,
            $\gamma_{1}\cdot{f}\cdot\overline{\gamma}_{1}$ is a loop at $x$ and
            similarly for $\gamma_{2}$. Moreover,
            $\gamma_{1}\cdot\overline{\gamma}_{2}$ is a loop at $x$. Thus:
            \begin{subequations}
                \begin{align}
                    \beta_{\gamma_{1}}([f])
                    &=[\gamma_{1}\cdot{f}\cdot\overline{\gamma}_{1}]\\
                    &=[\gamma_{1}\cdot\overline{\gamma}_{2}
                        \cdot\gamma_{2}\cdot{f}\cdot\overline{\gamma}_{1}]\\
                    &=[\gamma_{1}\cdot\overline{\gamma}_{2}]\cdot
                        [\gamma_{2}\cdot{f}\cdot\overline{\gamma}_{1}]\\
                    &=[\gamma_{2}\cdot{f}\cdot\overline{\gamma}_{1}]\cdot
                        [\gamma_{1}\cdot\overline{\gamma}_{2}]\\
                    &=[\gamma_{2}\cdot{f}\cdot\overline{\gamma}_{1}\cdot
                        \gamma_{1}\cdot\overline{\gamma}_{2}]\\
                    &=[\gamma_{2}\cdot{f}\cdot\overline{\gamma}_{2}]\\
                    &=\beta_{\gamma_{2}}([f])
                \end{align}
            \end{subequations}
            Hence $\beta$ only depends on the endpoints. Now, if $\beta$ only
            depends on the endpoint, then $\pi_{1}(X,x)$ is Abelian. Let
            $f,g$ be loops at $x$, and let $\gamma$ be the constant loop at $x$.
            But then:
            \begin{subequations}
                \begin{align}
                    \beta_{f}([g])&=[f\cdot{g}\cdot\overline{f}]\\
                    &=\beta_{\gamma}([g])\\
                    &=[g]
                \end{align}
            \end{subequations}
            Hence $f\cdot{g}\cdot\overline{f}$ is homotopic to $g$. By concatenating
            both sides on the right by $f$ we have $[f]\cdot[g]=[g]\cdot[f]$ showing
            us the fundamental group is Abelian.
        \end{solution}
        \begin{problem}
            Show that the following are equivalent:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Every map $\nsphere[1]\rightarrow{X}$ is homotopic to a
                      constant map.
                \item Every map $\nsphere[1]\rightarrow{X}$ can be extended to a
                      continuous function $D^{2}\rightarrow{X}$.
                \item $\pi_{1}(X,x_{0})=\{e\}$ for all $x_{0}\in{X}$.
            \end{enumerate}
        \end{problem}
        \begin{solution}
            $(1\Rightarrow{2})$ If $f:\nsphere[1]\rightarrow{X}$ is homotopic to a
            constant map, then let $H:\nsphere[1]\times{I}\rightarrow{X}$ be such a
            homotopy. Then $H(x,1)=const$ for all $x\in\nsphere[1]$ so we may obtain
            a well-defined continuous map by passing $H$ to the quotient
            $(\nsphere[1]\times{I})/R$ where $R$ identifies $\nsphere[1]\times\{1\}$
            to a point. But the cylinder with it's top boundary identified is
            homeomorphic to $D^{2}$ so we may pass this function to $D^{2}$ giving
            us an extension of $f$.
            \par\hfill\par
            $(2\Rightarrow{3})$ Let $x_{0}\in{X}$ be arbitrary and let
            $f:I\rightarrow{X}$ be a loop based at $x_{0}$. We obtain a continuous
            function $\tilde{f}:\nsphere[1]\rightarrow{X}$ from $f$ since
            $f(0)=f(1)$, and since $I/R$ is homeomorphic to $\nsphere[1]$
            where $R$ is the equivalence relation identifying 0 and 1. Hence $f$ may
            be passed to the quotient. But by hypothesis any continuous function
            $\tilde{f}:\nsphere[1]\rightarrow{X}$ extends to a continuous function
            on $D^{2}$. But $D^{2}$ is contractible, and moreover there is a
            deformation retract of $D^{2}$ down to the point $(1,0)\in\nsphere[1]$
            which is the point identified with $f(0)=x_{0}$.
            But this deformation retraction gives us a homotopy of
            $f$ to the constant map $g:I\rightarrow{X}$ defined by $g(t)=x_{0}$.
            Since $x_{0}$ and $f$ are arbitrary, this shows $\pi_{1}(X,x_{0})$ is
            trivial for all $x_{0}\in{X}$.
            \par\hfill\par
            $(3\Rightarrow{1})$ This is more-or-less the definition of a trivial
            fundamental group. Let $f:\nsphere[1]\rightarrow{X}$ be a continuous
            function and let $x_{0}=f(1,0)$. Let $\tilde{f}$ be the loop defined by
            $\tilde{f}(t)=f(\exp(2\pi{i}t))$. Then $\tilde{f}$ is a loop at the
            point $x_{0}$, but $\pi_{1}(X,x_{0})$ is trivial and hence this is
            homotopic to the constant map $g:I\rightarrow{X}$ defined by
            $g(t)=x_{0}$. Lifting this homotopy to $f$ shows us that $f$ is also
            homotopic to a constant map.
            \par\hfill\par
            $X$ is simply connected if and only if all continuous maps from
            $\nsphere[1]$ into $X$ are homotopic. Firstly, this implies $X$ is
            path connected. For given $x,y\in{X}$ let $f$ be the constant map at
            $x$ and $g$ the constant map at $y$ (both having domains $\nsphere[1]$).
            By hypothesis these are homotopic so let $H$ be a homotopy. Then
            $H(0,t)$ is a path from $x$ to $y$. From the previous argument, if every
            map $\nsphere[1]\rightarrow{X}$ is homotopic to a point, then
            $\pi_{1}(X,x_{0})$ is trivial for all $x_{0}\in{X}$. Hence, $X$ is path
            connected with trivial fundamental group, and is therefore simply
            connected. In the other direction, if $X$ is simply connected then it is
            path connected and $\pi_{1}(X,x_{0})$ is trivial for all $x_{0}\in{X}$.
            Then, given any two maps $f,g:\nsphere[1]\rightarrow{X}$, let
            $x_{0}=f(0,0)$ and $x_{1}=g(0,0)$. But $\pi_{1}(X,x_{0})$ is trivial so
            $f$ is homotopic to the constant map at $x_{0}$, and similarly for
            $g$. But $X$ is path connected so the constant map at $x_{0}$ is
            homotopic to the constant map at $x_{1}$. Since homotopic is a
            transitive relation we have that $f$ is homotopic to $g$. Hence $X$ is
            simply connected if and only if every pair of continuous functions
            from $\nsphere[1]$ are homotopic.
        \end{solution}

        \section{Homotopy Groups}
            The $n^{th}$ homotopy group of a topological space with respect to a
            base point $x_{0}\in{X}$ is the group $\pi_{n}(X,x_{0})$ of all
            homotopy classes of continuous functions $f:I^{n}\rightarrow{X}$
            where $f[\partial{I}^{n}]=x_{0}$. The operation of the group is
            concatenation along the last variable. That is,
            $[f]*[g]$ is the homotopy class of the function
            $h$ where $h(t_{1},\dots,t_{n})$ is equal to
            $f(t_{1},\dots,2t_{n})$ for $0\leq{t}_{n}\leq{1}/2$, and
            $g(t_{1},\dots,2t_{n}-1)$ for $1/2<t_{n}\leq{1}$. For $n\geq{2}$ the
            homotopy groups are Abelian.

    \begin{example}
        $SO(3)$, $3\times{3}$ matrices that are orthogonal and have determinant
        1, and $SU(2)$. Both of these are differentiable manifolds. How can we
        determine if they are homeomorphic or not? To every continuous map
        between topological spaces $X$ and $Y$ we can correspond groups $G(X)$
        and $G(Y)$ and a group homomorphism $\varphi:G(X)\rightarrow{G}(Y)$ that
        corresponds somehow to the continuous function. By showing that certain
        properties are preserved by this correspondence we can show that $SO(3)$
        and $SU(2)$ are not homeomorphic.
    \end{example}
    \begin{align}
        &f:X\rightarrow{Y}\rightarrow{Z}\\
        &\varphi:G(X)\rightarrow{G}(Y)\rightarrow{G}(Z)
    \end{align}
    The maps between topological spaces and groups are called \textit{Functors}.
    The category of topological spaces is somewhat to large. From point-set
    topology there are many pathelogical sets that are difficult to manage. In
    differential topology we study smooth manifolds which are locally like
    Euclidean space and have a lot of structure on them. Even nicer are
    \textit{Affine Varieties}, which are solution sets to polynomials that are
    studied in algebraic geometry. In the late 1940s Whitehead came up with the
    following category, that of CW Complexes. Not every topological space is a
    CW Complex, but in some respect every topological space is like a CW
    complex. All manifolds are CW complexes.
    \subsection{Homotopy Equivalence}
        Two steps or criteria that are common in algebraic
        topology.
        \begin{ldefinition}{CW Pair}{CW Pair}
            A CW Pair, $(X,A)$, is a CW Complex $X$ and a
            subset $A\subseteq{X}$ such that $A$ is closed,
            and $A$ is the union of cells of $X$.
        \end{ldefinition}
        The set $A$ can be considered as a sub-complex
        of $X$.
        \begin{theorem}
            If $(X,A)$ is a CW pair and if $A$ is
            contractible, then $q:X\rightarrow{X}/A$
            is a homotopy equivalence.
        \end{theorem}
        So 1-Skeletons and 1 dimensional CW Complexes can
        be contracted down to a bunch of points with loops
        on the points. That is, homotopy equivalence is
        preserved. Circles are not contractible, as well
        we eventually see, so we cannot get rid of loops.
    \subsection{Homotopy Extension Property}
        Let $X(,\tau)$ be a topological space,
        $A\subseteq{X}$ a subspace, and let
        $f:A\rightarrow{Y}$ be continuous. Does
        $f$ extend to a map $\tilde{f}:X\rightarrow{X}$
        such that $\tilde{f}|_{A}=f$? Not always, let
        $A=S^{1}$ and $X$ be the torus. For which pairs
        $(X,A)$ is this always possible? Well, suppose
        it is true. Then $id_{A}:A\rightarrow{A}$ has
        an extension $\tilde{id}_{A}:X\rightarrow{A}$.
        But then $A$ is a retract of $X$. Thus, it
        is a necessary condition that $A$ is a retract
        of $X$ for it to be true. As it turns out, it is
        also a sufficient condition. If
        $r:X\rightarrow{A}$ is a retract
        \begin{ldefinition}{Homotopy Extension Property}{HEP}
            A subset $A\subseteq{X}$ with the homotopy
            extension property is a set such that for all
            maps $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ and for every
            homotopy $f_{t}:A\rightarrow{Y}$,
            $f_{0}=f|_{A}$, extends to a homotopy of
            $\tilde{f}_{t}:X\rightarrow{Y}$ with
            $\tilde{f}_{0}=f_{0}$.
        \end{ldefinition}
        \begin{theorem}
            Every CW Pair $(X,A)$ has the homotopy
            extension property.
        \end{theorem}
        Recall that if $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ is a map such that,
        for a given $A\subseteq{X}$, and for all $a\in{A}$,
        there is a fixed $y_{0}\in{Y}$ such that $f(a)=y$, then
        the quotient map $q:X\rightarrow{X/A}$ has a unique
        liften map $\overline{f}$ such that
        $\overline{f}\circ{q}=f$. Moreover, $\overline{f}$ is
        continuous with respect to the quotient topology.
        \begin{theorem}
            If $(X,A)$ is a CW pair, and if $A$ is
            homotopy equivalent to a point
            (Contractible), then the quotient map
            $q:X\rightarrow{X/A}$ is a homotopy
            equivalence.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{theorem}
            If $(X,A)$ is CW pair, $f,g:A\rightarrow{X_{0}}$
            are homotopic attaching maps, then:
            \begin{equation}
                X_{0}\cup_{f}X\simeq{X}_{0}\cup_{g}X
            \end{equation}
        \end{theorem}
    \subsection{Winding Number}
        \begin{theorem}
            If $f:[0,1]\rightarrow{S}^{1}$ is a continuous
            function, then there is a unique continuous lift
            $\tilde{f}:[0,1]\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ such that
            $f=q\circ\tilde{f}$, where $q$ is the quotient map
            of $\mathbb{R}$ onto $S^{1}$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            For let $\mathcal{U}_{1}=S^{1}\setminus\{(1,0)\}$ and
            $\mathcal{U}_{2}=S^{1}\setminus\{(0,1)\}$. This is an
            open cover of $S^{1}$. If $f:I\rightarrow{S}^{1}$ is
            continuous, then $f^{-1}(\mathcal{U}_{1})$ and
            $f^{-1}(\mathcal{U}_{2})$ form an open cover of
            $I$. But any open subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is the
            countable union of disjoint open intervals. Thus
            $f^{-1}(\mathcal{U}_{1})$ and
            $f^{-1}(\mathcal{U}_{2})$ are the countable union of
            disjoint open intervals. But $I$ is compact, and
            thus any open cover has a finite subcover. Therefore
            there are finitely many intervals $I_{1},\dots,I_{k}$
            such that $f(I_{k})\subseteq\mathcal{U}_{1}$ or
            $f(I_{k})\subseteq\mathcal{U}_{2}$.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{ldefinition}{Winding Number}{Winding_Number}
            The winding number of a loop
            $f:S^{1}\rightarrow{S}^{1}$ is:
            \begin{equation}
                wind(f)+\tilde{f}(1)-\tilde{f}(0)
            \end{equation}
            Where $\tilde{f}$ is a lifting map of $f$ to
            $\mathbb{R}$.
        \end{ldefinition}

    \par\hfill\par
    A loop is a continuous function $f:S^{1}\rightarrow{X}$. Given
    a loop $f:S^{1}\rightarrow{S}^{1}$, there is a lifting map
    $\tilde{f}:S^{1}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$. The winding number
    of the loop $f$ is defined as $w(f)=\tilde{f}(1)-\tilde{f}(0)$.
    \begin{theorem}
        If $f,g:S^{1}\rightarrow{S}^{1}$ are loops such that
        $f(0)=g(0)$, then $f\simeq{g}$ if and only if
        $w(f)=w(g)$.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        For let $\tilde{f},\tilde{g}$ be two lifts of $f$ and $g$,
        respectively, such that $\tilde{f}(0)=\tilde{g}(0)$.
        This can be done since given such lifts, they will differ
        by at most an integer. But if $w(f)=w(g)$, then
        $\tilde{f}(1)=\tilde{g}(1)$. Then let $H$ be the straight
        line homotopy between $\tilde{f}$ and $\tilde{g}$:
        \begin{equation}
            H(x,t)=\tilde{f}(x)t+(1-t)\tilde{g}(x)
        \end{equation}
        Let $h_{t}=qH$, where $q$ is the projection mapping. This
        is a homotopy between $f$ and $g$.
    \end{proof}
    Thus we have that the winding number is a homotopy invariant.
    Let $[X,y]$ be the set of homotopy equivalence classes of
    continuous maps $X\rightarrow{Y}$. Then $[S^{1},S^{1}]$ can
    be put into a one-to-one correspondence with $\mathbb{Z}$
    by mapping $f\mapsto{w}(f)$.
    \begin{theorem}
        There is no retract from $D^{2}$ onto it's boundary
        $\partial{D}^{2}=S^{1}$.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        Consider the identity map $id_{S^{1}}$. Then
        $w(id_{S^{1}})=1$. This is a loop in $D^{2}$ that is
        contractible to a point, and is thus null-homotopic.
        Suppose $r:D^{2}\rightarrow{S}^{1}$ is a retract. 
        Then $rf_{0}\simeq{r}f_{1}$, and thus
        $w(rf_{0})=w(rf_{1})$. But $w(rf_{0})=w(id_{S^{1}})=0$, and
        $rf_{1}$ is a point, so $w(rf_{1})=0$, a contradiction. Thus
        there is no retract.
    \end{proof}
    We now consider functors that take topological spaces to
    groups, mapping continuous functions to group homomorphisms.
    Recall that a path is a continuous function $f:I\rightarrow{X}$.
    A homotopy of paths $f,g$ is a function $F_{t}$ such that
    $F_{0}=f$ and $F_{1}=g$. The concatenation operation is:
    \begin{equation}
        (f*g)(t)=
        \begin{cases}
            f(2t),&0\leq{t}\leq\frac{1}{2}\\
            g(2t-1),&\frac{1}{2}<t\leq{1}
        \end{cases}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{theorem}
        If $U,V\subseteq{X}$ are closed sets, and if
        $U\cup{V}=X$, and if $k:X\rightarrow{Y}$ is such that
        $k|_{U}$ and $k|_{V}$ is continuous, then $k$ is continuous.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{theorem}
        If $f_{0}\simeq{f}_{1}$, $g_{0}\simeq{g}_{1}$, then
        $f_{0}*g_{0}\simeq{f}_{1}*g_{1}$.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        Concatenate homotopies: $h_{t}=f_{t}*g_{t}$. This is a
        homotopy.
    \end{proof}
    A loop is a path $f:I\rightarrow{X}$ such that $f(0)=f(1)$, and
    this is called the base-point. We use this notion to define the
    fundamental group $\pi_{1}(X,x_{0})$.
    \begin{ldefinition}{Fundamental Group}{Fun_Group}
        The fundemtanl group of a topological space $X$ with a
        base point $x_{0}$ is the set:
        \begin{equation}
            \pi_{1}(X,x_{0})=\{[f]:f\in{C}(S^{1},X)\}
        \end{equation}
        Where equivalent functions are functions that are homotopy
        equivalent.
    \end{ldefinition}
    \begin{theorem}
        If $f:I\rightarrow{X}$, $\phi:I\rightarrow{I}$ is such that
        $\phi(0)=0$ and $\phi(1)=1$, then $f\circ\phi\simeq{f}$.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        Let $\phi_{t}(s)=(1-t)\phi(s)+ts$. This is a homotopy between
        $\phi$ and $id_{I}$. Let $f_{t}=f\phi_{t}$. This is a
        homotopy.
    \end{proof}
    \begin{theorem}
        If $X$ is a topological space, $x_{0}\in{X}$, and if
        $*$ is the concatenation operation, then
        $(\pi_{1}(X,x_{0}),*)$ is a group.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{example}
        We have seen that $\pi_{1}(S^{1},x_{0})$ can be put into
        a correspondence with $\mathbb{Z}$, but moreover the
        group structure is preserved. That is,
        $(\pi_{1}(S^{1},x_{0}),*)$ is isomorphic to
        $(\mathbb{Z},+)$. While this group is Abelian,
        the fundamental of a topological space need not be, and
        in general it isn't.
    \end{example}
    \subsection{Lecture 6}
        Let $X$ be a space, and $x_{0}\in{X}$ a point in $X$.
        The fundamental group of $X$ with base point $x_{0}$
        is $\pi_{1}(X,x_{0})$, which is the set of loops with
        base point $x_{0}$, modulo homotopy, equipped with the
        concatenation operation.
        \begin{theorem}
            If $X$ and $Y$ are topological space, if
            $X\times{Y}$ has the product topology, and if
            $(x_{0},y_{0})\in{X}\times{Y}$, then:
            \begin{equation}
                \pi_{1}(X\times{Y},(x_{0},y_{0}))
                \simeq\pi_{1}(X,x_{0})\otimes\pi_{1}(Y,y_{0})
            \end{equation}
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{example}
            We have computed $\pi_{1}(S^{1},x_{0})$ for any
            point $x_{0}\in{S}^{1}$ by using the notion of
            winding number. We saw that:
            \begin{equation}
                \pi_{1}(S^{1},x_{0})\simeq\mathbb{Z}
            \end{equation}
            But the torus $T^{2}$ can be seen as
            $S^{1}\times{S}^{1}$. Thus, for any point
            $x_{0}\in{T}^{2}$, we have:
            \begin{equation}
                \pi_{1}(T^{2})\simeq
                \mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}
                =\mathbb{Z}^{2}
            \end{equation}
            We've seen that the torus can be identified by
            an equivalence relation on the square, which then
            creates two loops. These are the two inner circles
            of the torus. It turns out that any loop in the
            torus is going to be the product of these two loops.
            That is, the fundamental group is generated by
            two elements. By considering a trivial example,
            we see that this group has the relation:
            \begin{equation}
                \pi_{1}(S^{1},x_{0})=
                \langle{a,b}|aba^{-1}b^{-1}=e\rangle
            \end{equation}
            This relation says that:
            \begin{equation}
                ab=ba
            \end{equation}
            And thus the group is Abelian. So we have that
            the fundamental group is an Abelian group
            generated by two elements, and thus we see the
            isomorphism with $\mathbb{Z}^{2}$.
        \end{example}
        Recall that a loop is a map $f:I\rightarrow{X}$
        such that $f(0)=f(1)$. This is equivalent to a
        function $f:S^{1}\rightarrow{X}$. We can use this to
        define the higher homotopy groups, $\pi_{n}(X,x_{0})$,
        by considering functions $f:S^{n}\rightarrow{X}$,
        modulo homotopy. For $n\geq{2}$,
        $\pi_{n}(X,x_{0})$ is Abelian. There's also
        $\pi_{0}(X,x_{0})$, which is not a group in general,
        but counts the number of path connected components.
        Moving on to the base point, this is mostly annoying.
        It seems that most of the time it doesn't matter which
        one we pick, provided that the space has one connected
        component. Recall that the fundamental group can be
        seen as a functor that maps pointed topological
        spaces to a group such that continuous maps
        $\varphi:(X,x_{0})\rightarrow(Y,y_{0})$ are mapped
        to group homomorphisms
        $\varphi_{*}:\pi_{1}(X,x_{0})\rightarrow\pi_{1}(Y,y_{0})$.
        Given a loop $f:S^{1}\rightarrow{X}$ and a continuous
        function $\varphi:X\rightarrow{Y}$, we take the
        composition $\varphi\circ{f}$ and map the equivalence
        class of $f$ to the equivalence class of
        $\varphi\circ{f}$. That is:
        \begin{equation}
            \varphi_{*}([f])=[\varphi\circ{f}]
        \end{equation}
        Then $\varphi$ is a group homomorphism between the
        two fundamental groups. Functors have the requirement
        that:
        \begin{align}
            (X,x_{0})\overset{f}{\longrightarrow}
            (Y,y_{0})\overset{g}{\longrightarrow}
            (Z,z_{0})\\
            \pi_{1}(X,x_{0})
                \underset{\varphi_{*}}{\longrightarrow}
            \pi_{1}(Y,y_{0})
                \underset{\psi_{*}}{\longrightarrow}
            \pi_{1}(Z,z_{0})
        \end{align}
        With the constraint that:
        \begin{equation}
            (\psi\varphi)_{*}=\psi_{1}\circ\varphi_{*}
        \end{equation}
        Given a homotopy of loops:
        \begin{equation}
            \varphi_{t}:(X,x_{0})\rightarrow(Y,y_{0})
        \end{equation}
        such that, for all $t\in{I}$, $\varphi_{t}(x_{0})=y_{0}$.
        Then:
        \begin{equation}
            (\varphi_{1})_{*}=(\varphi_{2})_{*}
        \end{equation}
        \begin{theorem}
            If $X$ is path connected, and if $x_{0},x_{1}\in{X}$,
            then:
            \begin{equation}
                \pi_{1}(X,x_{0})\simeq\pi_{1}(X,x_{1})
            \end{equation}
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            For let $h:I\rightarrow{X}$ be such that
            $h(0)=x_{0}$ and $h_{1}=x_{1}$. This is possible
            since $X$ is path connected. Define:
            \begin{equation}
                \beta_{h}:\pi_{1}(X,x_{0})\rightarrow
                \pi_{1}(X,x_{1})\quad\quad
                \beta_{h}([f])=[h^{\minus{1}}\circ{f}\circ{h}]
            \end{equation}
            Then this is well defined and is a group homomorphism.
            Moreover it is an isomorphism since there's an
            inverse. Therefore, etc.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
            If $\varphi_{t}:X\rightarrow{Y}$ is a homotopy,
            if $y_{0}=\varphi_{0}(x_{0})$, and if
            $y_{0}=\varphi_{1}(x_{0})$, then
            $\pi_{1}(Y,y_{0})$ is isomorphic to
            $\pi_{1}(Y,y_{1})$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{theorem}
            If $\varphi:X\rightarrow{Y}$ is a homotopy
            equivalence and if $\varphi(x_{0})=y_{0}$, then
            $\pi_{1}(X,x_{0})$ is isomorphic to
            $\pi_{1}(Y,y_{0})$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            For if $\varphi:X\rightarrow{Y}$ is a homotopy
            equivalence then there is an
            $\psi:Y\rightarrow{X}$ such that
            $\varphi\psi\simeq id_{Y}$ and
            $\psi\varphi\simeq id_{X}$. Then
            $\psi_{*}\varphi_{*}=(\psi\varphi){*}$.
        \end{proof}
        That is, homotopy equivalent spaces have the same
        fundamental groups.
        \section{Lecture 7-ish, Maybe}
            We've computed the following:
            \begin{equation}
                \pi_{1}(\mathbb{Z},x_{0})=
                \begin{cases}
                    \mathbb{Z},&n=1\\
                    \{e\},&n\geq{2}
                \end{cases}
            \end{equation}
            Where $\{e\}$ denotes the trivial group. Let's
            now prove this.
            \begin{theorem}
                If $n\geq{2}$, and if $x_{0}\in{S}^{1}$, then
                $\pi_{1}(S^{n},x_{0})\simeq\{e\}$.
            \end{theorem}
            \begin{proof}
                What we want to do is take any loop $\gamma$,
                remove a point that
                $\gamma$ doesn't map to, and then use the fact
                that $S^{n}\setminus\{x\}$ is homeomorphic to
                $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Since $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is
                contractible, we are done. However, there exist
                space filling curves. So now we need to show that
                space filling curves can still be contracted.
                Pick $x\in{S]^[n}$ such that $x\ne{x}_{0}$. Then
                there is an ope ball $B$ centered about $x$ such
                that $x_{0}\notin{B}$. But $B$ is open and
                $\gamma$ is continuous Thus, $\gamma^{\minus{1}}$ is
                open in $[0,1]$. But since $x_{0}\notin{B}$,
                $0,1\notin\gamma^{\minus{1}}(B)$, and therefore
                the pre-image is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}$ as
                well. But every open subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is the
                disjoint union of open intervals. Let
                $(a,b)$ be one of these intervals. But then
                $f:(a,b)\rightarrow{B}$ is such that
                $f(a),f(b)\notin{B}$. But
                $\partial{B}\simeq{S}^{n-1}$ for $n\geq{2}$, and
                $S^{n-1}$ is path connected. Lift the image
                continuously to the bounded. This works if there
                are finitely many such intervals $(a,b)$, but there
                could be countably infinitely many. But
                $f^{\minus{1}}(x)$ is closed and is a subset of
                $S^{n}$, and is thereore closed and bounded and thus
                compact, by Heine-Borel. thus finitely many of the
                $(a_{i},b_{i})$ cover $f^{\minus{1}}(x)$. Move these
                ones. Thus, we can remove $x$ and complete the proof.
            \end{proof}
            We next move to Van Kampen's theorem. As an aside we must
            talk about free products of groups. The direct product
            of two groups $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$ is defined by:
            \begin{equation}
                (x_{1},x_{2})*(y_{1},y_{2})=
                (x_{1}*y_{1},x_{2}*y_{2})
            \end{equation}
            There is a universal property on such groups that goes
            as follows:
            \begin{theorem}
                If $G_{1},G_{2}$, and $H$ are groups such that
                there are group homomorphisms
                $\varphi_{i}:H\rightarrow{G}_{i}$, then there is
                a unique group homomorphism
                $\psi:H\rightarrow{G}_{1}\times{G}_{2}$ such that:
                \begin{equation}
                    \psi(h)=(\varphi_{1}(h),\varphi_{2}(h))
                \end{equation}
            \end{theorem}
            We want to flip this picture and define something called
            the \textit{free product} of $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$. This
            is some group $G_{1}*G_{2}$ such that it contains,
            disjointly, all of the elements of $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$,
            with no relations between elements of $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$.
            This is the set of \textit{reduced words}. Here, a word
            is something in an \textit{alphabet}, or a set. We take
            as our alphabet the disjoint union of $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$.
            A word is a finite ordered sequence from this alphabet.
            This includes the empty word, which is simply the empty
            set. A reduced word is a word such that $a_{n}$ and
            $a_{n+1}$ are not from the same group, and also none of
            the letters $a_{n}$ are the identity element in either
            $G_{1}$ or $G_{2}$. The product is then to concatenate
            two reduced words, and then further reduce the
            concatenation. Similarly, for a set of groups
            $\{G_{\alpha}:\alpha\in{I}\}$, the free product:
            \begin{equation}
                \ast_{\alpha\in{I}}G_{\alpha}
                =\{\textrm{Reduced Word in }
                    \coprod_{\alpha\in{I}}G_{\alpha}\}
            \end{equation}
            Again, there is a unique group that satisfies the
            universal property mentioned earlier. As a special
            exmaple, consider $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$. This has
            a Cayley group, and the Cayley actually reveals the
            group structure. That is, there are two generators,
            $a=(0,1)$ and $b=(1,0)$, and has the relation that
            $ab=ba$. The Cayley graph of $\mathbb{Z}*\mathbb{Z}$
            shows that this is the free group on 2 generators. It
            is a non-trivial question to show whether or not
            $F_{n}$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}^{n}$.
        \section{Van Kampen's Theorem}
            \begin{ltheorem}{Van Kampen's Theorem}
                If $X$ is path connected, if $x_{0}\in{X}$, and if
                $X$ is such that:
                \begin{equation}
                    X=\bigcup_{\alpha\in{J}}A_{\alpha}
                \end{equation}
                Where $x_{0}\in{A}_{\alpha}$ for all
                $\alpha\in{I}$, $A_{\alpha}$ is path-connected,
                $A_{a}\cap{A}_{b}$ is path-connected, and
                $A_{a}\cap{A}_{b}\cap{A}_{c}$ is path-connected, then
                for all $[f]\in\pi_{1}(X,x_{0})$, $[f]$ can be
                factored in $\pi_{1}(X,x_{0})$ as the product:
                \begin{equation}
                    [f]=[f_{1}]\cdot[f_{2}]\cdots[f_{m}]
                \end{equation}
                Where $f_{j}:I\rightarrow{A}_{\alpha_{j}}$ for each
                $j\in\mathbb{Z}_{m}$.
            \end{ltheorem}
            This is intuitively clear, given a loop in the space
            $X$ we can write it as a concatenation of different
            loops contained in each of the $A_{\alpha_{j}}$.
            But this theorem relates topology to algebra by the
            use of these free groups and free products.
            \subsection{Examples}
                \begin{example}
                    Let $X$ be a torus with two internal circles
                    identified. This is equivalent to two spheres
                    attached by two lines, which is homotopic equivalent
                    to two spheres and two loops, all joined at one
                    point. That is,
                    \begin{equation}
                        X\approx{S}^{1}\lor{S}^{1}\lor{S}^{2}\lor{S}^{2}
                    \end{equation}
                    The fundamental group of wedge sums has the
                    following property:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \pi_{1}(\lor_{\alpha}X_{\alpha})=
                        \star_{\alpha}\pi_{1}(X_{\alpha})
                    \end{equation}
                    The condition is that the base point in each
                    $X_{\alpha}$ must have a neighborhood
                    $\mathcal{U}_{\alpha}\in{X}_{\alpha}$ that
                    deformation retracts onto the base point.
                \end{example}
                Given a graph, infinite or not, what is the fundamental
                group of the graph? First fint a maximal spanning
                tree. Tree's are contractible, and thus we have:
                \begin{equation}
                    \pi_{1}(Graph)\simeq\pi_{1}(graph/tree)
                \end{equation}
                This last thing is the free group with generators of
                the edges the are not removed in the modulo.
                A know is a diffeomorphic copy of $S^{1}$ in
                $\mathbb{R}^{3}$. Links are several knots put together.
                Moving on to finite CW complex, consider $X$, which
                is $n\in\mathbb{N}$ dimensional, and has skeletons
                $X^{0},\dots,X^{n}$. Then $\pi_{1}(X^{1})$ is a
                free group since $X^{1}$ is a graph. What about
                $\pi_{1}(X^{2})$? We use Van Kampen's theorem to
                simplify this problem. $X^{2}$ is obtained from
                $X^{1}$ by attaching 2-cells $e_{\alpha}^{2}$,
                $\alpha\in{J}$, where $J$ is some index set, via
                attaching maps:
                $\varphi_{\alpha}:S^{1}\rightarrow{X}^{1}$.
                \begin{theorem}
                    $\pi_{1}(X^{2})=\pi_{1}(X^{1})/N$
                    Where $N$ is the normal subgroup generated by
                    $[\gamma_{\alpha}\varphi_{\alpha}\gamma_{\alpha}]$
                    in $\pi_{1}(X^{1})$.
                \end{theorem}
                \begin{theorem}
                    $\pi_{1}(X)\simeq\pi_{1}(X^{2})$.
                \end{theorem}
                So what is $\pi_{1}$ of a two torus? We can write
                the two torus as an octogon with relations on the
                sides. There are four such relations, and we get
                that the fundamental group is the group generated by
                four elements with the condition that:
                \begin{equation}
                    aba^{\minus{1}}b^{\minus{1}}
                    cdc^{\minus{1}}d^{\minus{1}}=e
                \end{equation}
                \begin{theorem}
                    If $X$ is a CW complex, and if
                    $x_{0}$ is a vertex, or a point in the one skeleton
                    of $X$, then:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \pi_{1}(X,x_{0})=\pi_{1}(X^{2},x_{0})
                        =\pi_{1}(X,x_{0})/N
                    \end{equation}
                \end{theorem}
                There are higher homotopy groups, $\pi_{k}(X,x_{0})$.
                These are homotopy classes of maps
                $f:S^{k}\rightarrow{X}$ such that $f(0)=x_{0}$.
                \begin{theorem}
                    If $X$ and $Y$ are CW complexes, if
                    $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ is continuous, and if $f$ is
                    a homotopy equivalence, then there are group
                    homomorphisms
                    $f_{*}:\pi_{k}(X,x_{0})\rightarrow{\pi}_{k}(Y,y_{0})$
                    for all $k\in\mathbb{N}$.
                \end{theorem}
                Whitehead's theorem says the converse of this is true
                as well.
                \begin{ltheorem}{Whitehead's Theorem}
                    The converse of the previous theorem is true.
                \end{ltheorem}
                \begin{theorem}
                    If $X$ is a topological space, then there exists
                    a CW complex $X'$ and a map
                    $f:X'\rightarrow{X}$ such that
                    $f_{*}:\pi_{k}(X')\simeq\pi_{k}(X)$.
                \end{theorem}
                This says that every topological space has a unique,
                up to homotopy equivalence, CW complex that approximates
                the space very well.
        \section{Covering Spaces}
            There's a deep link between covering spaces and Galois
            theory. When studying the fundamental group of a circle
            we came across loops $f:I\rightarrow{S}^{1}$ such that
            $f(0)=f(1)$. We studied the map
            $p(t)=\exp(2\pi{i}t)$ which spiralled $\mathbb{R}$ into
            the circle, and used this to define the winding number
            and calculate the fundamental group. This notion
            generalizes to other spaces.
            \begin{ldefinition}{Covering Space}
                A covering space of $X$ is a space $\tilde{X}$ such
                that, for al $x\in{X}$, there is an open neighborhood
                $\mathcal{U}_{x}\subseteq{X}$ such that
                $p^{\minus{1}}(\mathcal{U})$ is the disjoint union
                of open sets in $\tilde{X}$ and such that
                the image under $p$ of one of these sets is a
                homeomorphism with $\mathcal{U}$..
            \end{ldefinition}
            The first example is $\mathbb{R}$ and $S^{1}$. We will prove
            that nice enough topological spaces $X$ have a covering
            space $\tilde{X}$ such that $\tilde{X}$ is contractible.
            Such covers are unique up to homotopy. These are called
            the universal covers of the space. We will also show that
            there is a one-to-one correspondence between subgroups
            of $\pi_{1}(X)$ and covering spaces. That is, there
            is a function
            $\rho_{*}:\pi_{1}(\tilde{X})\rightarrow\pi_{1}(X)$ that
            is injective.
        \section{Universal Cover}
            We now discuss the existence of universal covers.
            This notion relations to Lie groups, representation theory,
            the special orthogonal group $SO(n)$, and it occurs
            in modern physics. $SO(n)$ is not simply connected, but
            it's universal cover, the spin group, is simply
            connected.
            \begin{ldefinition}{Simply Connected Space}
                A simply connected topological space is a path
                connected topological space $(X,\tau)$ such that
                for any two points $x,y\in{X}$ and any two paths
                $\gamma_{1},\gamma_{2}$ between $x$ and $y$,
                $\gamma_{1}$ and $\gamma_{2}$ are homotopic.
            \end{ldefinition}
            That is, $\pi_{0}(X)$ is trivial, there is only one
            path component, and $\pi_{1}(X,x_{0})$ is also
            trivial for all $x_{0}\in{X}$.
            \begin{example}
                $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is simply connected for all
                $n\in\mathbb{N}$. Given two paths between the same
                two points, the straight line homotopy is a homotopy
                between such paths. For $n\geq{2}$, $S^{n}$ is
                also simply connected. However, $S^{1}$ is not
                simply connected. For $\mathbb{RP}^{2}$, we know
                that $\pi_{1}(\mathbb{RP}^{2})=\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$,
                which is a two element group. Thus there is, up to
                homotopy, only one non-trivial loop in
                $\mathbb{RP}^{2}$. Therefore the real projective plane
                is not simply connected. There's a clear candidate for
                the universal cover of $\mathbb{RP}^{2}$, and that is
                the sphere $S^{2}$.
            \end{example}
            \begin{example}
                We know that the torus $T^{2}=S^{1}\times{S}^{1}$ is
                not simply connected, since the fundamental group of
                $T^{2}$ is the product of the fundamental group
                of $S^{1}$ with itself, that is, $\mathbb{Z}^{2}$. The
                universal cover of $T^{2}$ is $\mathbb{R}^{2}$. If
                we had a surface with $n$ wholes, it is not
                automatically clear what the universal cover is, but
                this turns out to be $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ as well.
            \end{example}
            One question that arises is which topological spaces have
            a universal cover? It is true for all CW complexes, and
            there is the following necessary condition.
            If $X$ is a topological space, and if there is a
            universal cover $\tilde{X}$, then for all
            $x\in{X}$, if $\tilde{x}$ is such that
            $p(\tilde{x})=x$, then $\mathcal{U}\subseteq{X}$, where
            $x\in\mathcal{U}$, evenly covered and
            $\tilde{x}\in\tilde{\mathcal{U}}$, which is homeomorphic
            to $\mathcal{U}$. Given any loop
            $\gamma:I\rightarrow\mathcal{U}$, where $\gamma(0)=x$,
            this lifts to a loop $\tilde{\gamma}$ in
            $\tilde{\mathcal{U}}$. But $\tilde{\mathcal{U}}$ is
            simply connected, and thus $\tilde{\gamma}$ is null
            homotopic in $\tilde{X}$. Thus, we have the following
            definition:
            \begin{ldefinition}{Semi-Locally Simply Connected Space}
                A semi-locally connected space is a topological
                space $(X,\tau)$ such that for all $x\in{X}$ there is
                a neighborhood $\mathcal{U}$ such that for loop in
                $\mathcal{U}$ contracts in $X$.
            \end{ldefinition}
            When speaking of a local property, one usually requires that
            a certain property holds in every open set about a certain
            point. For example, locally compact spaces are topological
            spaces such that for every point $x$ and every open
            neighborhood of $x$ there is a compact subset $V$ contained
            in this neighborhood. We have the following chain:
            \begin{equation}
                \begin{split}
                    \textrm{CW}\Longrightarrow
                    &\textrm{Locally Contractible}\Longrightarrow
                    \textrm{Locally Simply-Connected}
                    \Longrightarrow\cdots\\
                    &\cdots\Longrightarrow
                    \textrm{Semi-Locally Simply-Connected}
                \end{split}
            \end{equation}
            There are two examples of spaces that look very similar,
            but not homeomorphic. One is the Hawaiian earrings, and
            the other is the countable $\lor{S}^{1}$. The Hawaiian
            earrings are not semi-locally simply connected, whereas
            the other set is locally contractible. Thus these two
            spaces are not homeomorphic. Now for a sufficient condition
            for $X$ to have a universal cover.
            \begin{theorem}
                If $X$ is path connected, locally path conneccted,
                and semi-locally path connected, then there exists
                a simply connected cover of $X$.
            \end{theorem}
            \begin{proof}
                Let $\tilde{X}$ be the set of homotopy equivalence
                classes of paths $\gamma:I\rightarrow{X}$ such that
                $\gamma(0)=x_{0}$. We need a function
                $p:\tilde{X}\rightarrow{X}$ such that
                $p([\gamma])=\gamma(1)$. Next we need a topology
                on $\tilde{X}$. Recall that for a basis for a topology
                of a topological space $Y$ is a collection
                $\mathcal{B}$ of open subsets of $Y$ with the property
                that for all $y\in{Y}$, $\mathcal{U}\subseteq{Y}$ is
                open and $y\in\mathcal{U}$, there is a $V\in\mathcal{B}$
                such that $y\in{V}\subseteq\mathcal{U}$. For a set
                $Z$, a collection $\mathcal{B}$ of subsets of $Z$
                can be used a the basis of a topology on $Z$ if
                for all $U,V\in\mathcal{B}$, and for all
                $x\in{U}\cap{V}$, there is a $W\in\mathcal{B}$ such
                that $x\in{W}\subseteq{U}\cap{V}$. Define
                $\mathcal{B}$ as follows:
                \begin{equation}
                    \mathcal{B}=\{B\subseteq{X}:B\in\tau,
                        B\textrm{ path connected and }
                        \pi_{1}(B)\rightarrow\pi_{1}(X)
                        \textrm{ is trivial}\}
                \end{equation}
                $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for the topology of
                $X$. For since $X$ is semi-locally simply connected,
                for all $x\in{X}$ there is a $V\subseteq{X}$ such
                that $x\in{V}$ and
                $\pi_{1}(V)\rightarrow\pi_{1}(X)$ is trivial. But
                $X$ is locally path-connected, and thus there is an
                open $W\subseteq{U}\cap{V}$ such that $x\in{W}$ and
                $W$ is path connected. From this we need to make a basis
                for $\tilde{X}$. For $\mathcal{U}\in\mathcal{B}$,
                let $\gamma:I\rightarrow{X}$ be such that
                $\gamma(0)=x\in\mathcal{U}$ and $\gamma(0)=x_{0}$.
                Define $\mathcal{U}_{\gamma}$ by:
                \begin{equation}
                    \mathcal{U}_{\gamma}=\{
                        [\gamma\eta]:\eta(0)=\gamma(1)\}
                \end{equation}
                The set of all $\mathcal{U}_{\gamma}$ define a basis
                for a topology on $\tilde{X}$.
            \end{proof}
            \begin{theorem}
                If $X$ is a path connected CW complex, then
                $X$ has a simply connected cover.
            \end{theorem}
            \begin{theorem}
                If $X$ is a manifold, then $X$ has a simply
                connected cover.
            \end{theorem}
        \section{Group Actions}
            Let $G$ be a discrete group, and $X$. There is a notion
            called a group action of $G$ on $X$. There are two ways
            of viewing this, as a function
            $p:G\times{X}\rightarrow{X}$, or as a function
            $p:G\rightarrow\textrm{Perm}(X)$, where $\textrm{Perm}$
            denotes the set of permutations of $X$. A third definition
            is $\rho(g):X\rightarrow{X}$ for $g\in{G}$.
            A group action obeys the group law:
            \begin{equation}
                p(g_{1},g_{2})=p(g_{1})p(g_{2})
            \end{equation}
            Given a topological space $X$, $\rho(g)$ continuous
            would imply that it is a homeomorphism, since it has
            a continuous inverse.
            \begin{example}
                $\mathbb{Z}^{2}$ acts on $\mathbb{R}^{2}$:
                \begin{equation}
                    \rho:\mathbb{Z}^{2}\rightarrow
                    \textrm{Homeo}(\mathbb{R}^{2})
                \end{equation}
                This is defined by
                $\rho(m,n):\mathbb{R}^{2}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{2}$
                by $(x,y)\mapsto(x+m,y+n)$. This translates all points
                in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ by the vector $(m,n)$. It suffices
                to define $\rho(g)$ on the generators $g$ of $G$.
                $\mathbb{Z}^{2}$ has the generators $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$.
                So:
                \begin{subequations}
                    \begin{align}
                        \rho((1,0))(x,y)&=(x+1,y)\\
                        \rho((0,1))(x,y)&=(x,y+1)
                    \end{align}
                \end{subequations}
                We now need to chack that
                $\rho(a)\rho(b)=\rho(b)\rho(a)$.
            \end{example}
            \begin{example}
                Let $G$ be the group defined by the presentation:
                \begin{equation}
                    G=\langle{a,b|ab=ba^{\minus{1}}}\rangle
                \end{equation}
                This acts on $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ by:
                \begin{subequations}
                    \begin{align}
                        \rho((1,0))(x,y)&=(x+1,y)\\
                        \rho((0,1))(x,y)&=(\minus{x},y+1)
                    \end{align}
                \end{subequations}
                We now need to check:
                \begin{equation}
                    \rho(a)\big(\rho(b)(x,y)\big)=
                    \rho(a)(\minus{x},y+1)=
                    (\minus{x}+1,y+1)
                \end{equation}
                And also:
                \begin{equation}
                    \rho(b)\big(\rho(a^{\minus{1}})(x,y)\big)=
                    \rho(b)(x-1,y)=(\minus{x}+1,y+1)
                \end{equation}
                And thus this is a valid Group action.
            \end{example}
            Given a group $G$ and a set $X$, we consider the
            \textit{orbit} space $G/X$ as a set. The elements are
            called the orbits. Given a topology on $X$, we take
            the topology on the orbit space to be the quotient
            topology.
            \begin{example}
                Taking the group action discussed earlier of
                $\mathbb{Z}^{2}$ over $\mathbb{R}^{2}$, the orbit
                space $\mathbb{R}^{2}/\mathbb{Z}^{2}$. and this is
                homeomorphic to $T^{2}$. In the other example, with
                $G=\langle{a,b|ab=ba^{\minus{1}}}\rangle$,
                we have that the orbit space is
                $\mathbb{R}^{2}/G$ is the Klein bottle.
            \end{example}
            In general, if $\pi_{1}(X,x_{0})=G$, then $G$ acts on
            the covering space
            $p:\tilde{X}\rightarrow{X}$ with $\pi_{1}(X)=0$. In
            particular, if $X$ is a CW complex.
            \begin{example}
                Let $p:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow{S}^{1}$ be defined by
                $p(t)=\exp(2\pi{i}t)$. We know that
                $\pi_{1}(S)=\mathbb{Z}$. The generator of
                $\mathbb{Z}$ acts by mapping
                $x\mapsto{x}+1$. Note that:
                \begin{equation}
                    \mathbb{R}/\pi_{1}(S^{1})\simeq
                    \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}\simeq
                    S^{1}
                \end{equation}
                This is, in general, true. COnsider the Klein bottle
                The universal cover of the Klein bottle is
                $\mathbb{R}^{2}$. 
            \end{example}
            \begin{theorem}
                If $X$ is a topological space that is path connected
                and a CW complex, then for every subgroup
                $H\subseteq\pi_{1}(X)$, there exists a cover
                $p:\tilde{X}_{H}\rightarrow{X}$ such that:
                \begin{equation}
                    p_{*}(\pi_{1}(\tilde{X}_{H},\tilde{x}_{0}))=H
                \end{equation}
                For suitable choice of $\tilde{x}_{0}$.
            \end{theorem}
            \begin{proof}
                Let $\tilde{X}\rightarrow{X}$ be a simply
                connected cover. Since $\pi_{1}(X,x_{0})=G$ acts on
                $\tilde{X}$, $H$ also acts on $\tilde{X}$. Now the
                quotient space $\tilde{X}/H$ has the desired
                properties.
            \end{proof}
            \subsection{Lifting Criterion}
                Given a space $X$ and a covering space
                $\tilde{X}$ with covering
                $p:\tilde{X}\rightarrow{X}$, and given a space
                $Y$ with a map $f:Y\rightarrow{X}$, when is there a
                \textit{lift} of the map $f$ to the covering
                space $\tilde{X}$? it seems natural to impose certain
                criterion on $Y$, and we require that $Y$ is
                path connected and locally path connected.
                1.33 in Hatcher.
                \begin{theorem}
                    If $p:\tilde{X}\rightarrow{X}$ is a covering space,
                    if $f:Y\rightarrow{X}$ is continuous, then a
                    lift $\tilde{f}$ exists if and only if
                    $f_{*}:\pi_{1}(Y,y_{0})\rightarrow\pi_{1}(X,x_{0})$
                    is such that
                    $\textrm{Ran}(f_{*})\subseteq\textrm{Ran}(p_{*})$,
                    where $\textrm{Ran}$ denotes that range of the
                    functions.
                \end{theorem}
                \begin{proof}
                    If $\tilde{f}$ exists, then
                    $f=\tilde{f}\circ{p}$, and thus
                    $f_{*}=p_{*}\circ{f}_{*}$, so the range of
                    $f_{*}$ is contained within the range of
                    $p_{*}$. The hard part is going the other way.
                    Now we need to construct such a lift.
                \end{proof}
        \section{Homology}
            \subsection{History}
                The basic root of the theory stems from the
                Euler number of a graph in the plane. That is,
                from his classic formula:
                \begin{align}
                    F-E+V&=1
                    \tag{Planar Graphs}\\
                    F-E+V&=2
                    \tag{Platonic Solids}
                \end{align}
                Similarly, if one triangulates a sphere, we again
                obtain $F-E+V=2$. So there's nothing to do with the
                nature of the platonic solids here, but rather that
                all of these objects are homeomorphic to the
                unit sphere. What about the torus? There's a formula
                for any surface with genus $g$, and we obtain:
                \begin{equation}
                    F-E+V=2-2g
                \end{equation}
                So, for a torus we get zero. Riemann furthered the
                theory in the 1850's when he introduced the notion of
                connectivity number. Betti and Riemann continue this
                work around 1870 and introduced the idea of Betti
                numbers. This is the number of cuts of dimension $k$
                are needed to disconnect a space. For a genus
                two surface, we see that the first Betti number is
                four, since we need two cuts for each hole. Moving on,
                Emmy Noether added more to the theory in 1925
                when she related this to groups. For example the
                Betti number 4 somehow relates to the group
                $\mathbb{Z}^{4}$, with Torsion. The first modern
                definition of homology groups comes from Mayer and
                Vietoris in 1928. Between 1930 and 1950, the theory
                began to develop into its current form. It now extends
                beyond topology and into algebra and group theory.
                There is also the notion of cohomology that came along
                with this.
            \subsection{Singular Homology}
                \begin{ldefinition}{Simplex}
                    A simplex of degree $n$ is a subset of
                    $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ form by $n$ points
                    that are affinely independent
                    $v_{0},\dots,v_{N}$, defined by the
                    convex hull:
                    \begin{equation}
                        [v_{0},\dots,v_{n}]=
                        \{\sum_{k=0}^{n}t_{k}v_{k}:
                            \sum_{k=0}^{n}t_{k}=1,t_{k}\geq{0}\}
                    \end{equation}
                \end{ldefinition}
                The standard simplex, denote $\Delta^{n}$, is the
                convex hull of $e_{1},\dots,e_{n+1}$. These are
                triangles, or tetrahedron's, etc.
                Every n-simplex with ordered vertices
                $[v_{0},v_{1},\dots,v_{n}]$ is canonically homeomorphic
                to $\Delta^{n}$. Take
                $t=(t_{0},t_{1},\dots,t_{n})$ and map this to
                $t_{0}v_{0}+\dots+t_{n}v_{n}$. In particular, each
                of the faces of an $n$ simplex comes with a map:
                \begin{equation}
                    [v_{0},\dots,v_{j},\dots,v_{n}]
                    \mapsto[v_{0},\dots,v_{j-1},v_{j+1},\dots,v_{n}]
                \end{equation}
                This is equivalent to the face mapping
                $\Delta^{n-1}\mapsto\Delta^{n}$.
                \subsubsection{Simplicial Homology}
                    Defined for $\Delta$ complexs.
                    \begin{ldefinition}{$\Delta$ Complex}
                        A topological space $X$ together with the
                        following structure:
                        \begin{enumerate}
                            \item A collection of continuous
                                  maps $\sigma:\Delta^{n}\rightarrow{X}$.
                            \item $\sigma(\Delta^{n}\setminus%
                                   \partial\Delta^{n})=e_{\alpha}^{n}$
                            \item The topology of $X$ is a CW topology.
                                  That is, $A\subseteq{X}$ is open
                                  if and only if
                                  $\sigma_{\alpha}^{\minus{1}}(A)$ is
                                  open in $\Delta^{n}$ for all
                                  $\alpha\in{J}$.
                            \item For $\sigma_{\alpha}:%
                                  \Delta^{n}\rightarrow{X}$ in the
                                  structure, so is
                                  $\sigma_{\alpha}\circ{F}_{j}^{n}$,
                                  where $F_{j}^{n}$ is the face map.
                        \end{enumerate}
                    \end{ldefinition}
                    \begin{ldefinition}{Chain Complex}
                        A sequence of a Abelian groups
                        $C_{n}$, one for each $n\in\mathbb{Z}$,
                        together with group homomorphisms
                        $\partial_{n}:C_{n}\rightarrow{C}_{n-1}$.
                        Such that $\partial_{n-1}\circ\partial_{n}=0$. 
                        Equivalently,
                        $\mathrm{Im}(\partial_{n})\subseteq%
                         \mathrm{ker}(\partial_{n-1})$.
                    \end{ldefinition}
                    We can also let:
                    \begin{equation}
                        C_{\cdot}=\oplus_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}C_{n}
                    \end{equation}
                    With a homomorphism:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \partial:C_{\cdot}\rightarrow{C}_{\cdot}
                    \end{equation}
                    That is a degree -1 homomorphism such that
                    $\partial^{2}=0$. The homology of a chain
                    complex is the collection of groups:
                    \begin{align}
                        Z_{n}&=\mathrm{ker}(\partial_{n})
                            \subseteq{C}_{n}\\

                            \subseteq{C}_{n}\\
                        H_{n}&=Z_{n}/B_{n}
                    \end{align}
                \subsubsection{Simplicial Homology}
                    Let $X$ be a $\Delta$ complex. That is, the
                    disjoint union of open simplices. We want to create
                    a chain complex:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \cdots\longrightarrow\Delta_{n}(X)

                        \longrightarrow{0}
                    \end{equation}
                    Form a free abelian group generated by
                    $\rho_{\alpha}^{n}$.
                    \begin{equation}

                        \sum(\minus{1})^{j}\sigma|
                        [v_{0},\dots,v_{j-1},v_{j+1},\dots,v_{n}]
                    \end{equation}
                    The $(\minus{1})^{j}$ term gives an orientation
                    to simplices.

                        $H_{0}(X)=\mathbb{Z}$.
                    \end{theorem}
                    What is an $n$ cycle? The abstract definition
                    is some finite combination of singular simplices:
                    $\sigma:\Delta^{n}\rightarrow{X}$, allowing
                    repetitions.
        \section{More Homology}
            \begin{theorem}
                \begin{equation}
                    H_{n}(S^{k})=
                    \begin{cases}
                        \mathbb{Z},&n=k,n=0\\
                        0,&\textrm{Otherwise}
                    \end{cases}
                \end{equation}
            \end{theorem}
            \begin{proof}
                We'll need to use the properties (Axioms) of singular
                homology. Let $X=D^{k}$ be the closed $k$ disk in
                $\mathbb{R}^{k}$. Let $A=\partial{D}^{k}=S^{k-1}$. Then
                $X.A\simeq{S}^{k}$. For CW pairs we have a long exact sequence
                as well as strong excision:
                \begin{equation}
                    \cdots\longrightarrow
                    \overset{A}{H_{n}(S^{k-1})}\longrightarrow
                    \overset{X}{H_{n}(D^{k})}\longrightarrow
                    \overset{X/A}{\tilde{H}_{n}(S^{k})}\longrightarrow
                    H_{n-1}(S^{k-1})\longrightarrow\cdots
                \end{equation}
                FOr $n\geq{2}$, we have:
                \begin{equation}
                    0\longrightarrow{H}_{n}(S^{k})
                    \overset{\partial}{\longrightarrow}H_{n-1}(S^{k-1})
                    \longrightarrow{0}
                \end{equation}
                The end of the sequence is then:
                \begin{equation}
                    H_{1}(D^{k})\longrightarrow
                    H_{1}(S^{k})\overset{\partial}{\longrightarrow}
                    H_{0}(S^{k-1})\longrightarrow{H}_{0}(D^{k})
                    \longrightarrow\tilde{H}_{0}(S^{k})\longrightarrow{0}
                \end{equation}
                But $H_{1}(D^{k})=0$, and so this reduces. When $k\geq{2}$
                we also have that $\tilde{H}_{0}(S^{k})=0$. So, for the case
                of $k\geq{2}$ we have:
                \begin{equation}
                    0\longrightarrow{H}_{1}(S^{k})\longrightarrow
                    H_{0}^{k-1}\longrightarrow{H}_{0}(D^{k})\longrightarrow{0}
                \end{equation}
                And this reduces to:
                \begin{equation}
                    0\longrightarrow0\longrightarrow0\longrightarrow
                    \mathbb{Z}\longrightarrow\mathbb{Z}\longrightarrow0
                \end{equation}
                The next case is $k=1$. We obtain the short exact sequence:
                \begin{equation}
                    0\longrightarrow{H}_{1}(S^{1})\longrightarrow
                    \mathbb{Z}^{2}\longrightarrow\mathbb{Z}\longrightarrow0
                \end{equation}
                From this we obtain $H_{1}(S^{1})=\mathbb{Z}$. Using induction,
                if $n>k\geq{1}$, then $H_{n}(S^{k})\simeq{H}_{1}(S^{k-n+1})$,
                and this is the trivial group. If $k=n\geq{1}$, then
                $H_{n}(S^{k})\simeq{H}_{1}(S^{1})=\mathbb{Z}$. Similarly for
                $k<n$.
            \end{proof}
            \begin{ltheorem}{Milnor's Uniqueness Theorem}{Milnor_Unqueness}
                If:
                \begin{equation}
                    H_{n}(\coprod_{\alpha}X_{\alpha})
                    =\oplus_{\alpha}H_{n}(X_{\alpha})
                \end{equation}
                Then all homology theories on the category of CW complexes
                are equivalent.
            \end{ltheorem}
            \begin{theorem}
                $H_{n}^{\Delta}(X)\simeq{H}_{n}(X)$.
            \end{theorem}
            \begin{equation}
                H_{n}^{\Delta}(X^{k},X^{k-1})=
                \begin{cases}
                    \textrm{Free Abelian Group Generated by n-cells},&n=k\\
                    0,&\textrm{Otherwise}
                \end{cases}
            \end{equation}
            Induction on the dimension of the skeleton. If $k=0$, and if
            $n>0$, then $H_{n}^{\Delta}(X^{0})=0$ and $H_{n}(X^{0})=0$. If
            $n=0$, then we obtain $\mathbb{Z}^{\oplus{c}}$, where $c$ is the
            number of connected components. The Five Lemma handles this.
        \section{Mayer-Vietoris Sequence}
            Mayer-Vietoris sequences are useful computational tools for
            computing homology. It is analogous to the van Kampen theorem
            for homotopy. Often used in proofs by induction on the
            number of dimensions.
            \begin{ltheorem}{Mayer-Vietoris Theorem}
                Given a space $X$ and two subsets $A,b\subseteq{X}$
                such that:
                \begin{equation}
                    X=\mathrm{Int}(A)\cup\mathrm{Int}(B)
                \end{equation}
                Then the Mayer-Vietoris sequence:
                \begin{equation}
                    \cdots\rightarrow{H}_{n}(A\cap{B})
                    \overset{\varphi}{\rightarrow}{H}_{n}(A)
                        \oplus{H}_{n}(B)\overset{\psi}{\rightarrow}
                        H_{n}(X)\rightarrow{H}_{n-1}(A\cap{B})
                        \rightarrow\cdots
                \end{equation}
                Is an exact sequence.
            \end{ltheorem}
            The maps are $\phi(x)=(\minus{x},x)$, and $\psi(x,y)=x+y$.
            $\varphi:C_{n}(A\cap{B})\rightarrow{C}_{n}(A)\oplus{C}_{n}(B)$
            and $\psi:C_{n}(A)\oplus{C}_{n}(B)\rightarrow{C}_{n}(X)$. To
            define $\partial$ connecting maps, we have a short exact
            sequence of chain complexes:
            \begin{equation}
                0\rightarrow{C}_{n}(A\cap{B})
                \overset{\varphi}{\rightarrow}C_{n}(A)\oplus{C}_{n}(B)
                \overset{\psi}{\rightarrow}C_{n}(A+B)\rightarrow{0}
            \end{equation}
            $n$ chains in $X$ such that each simplex
            $\sigma:\Delta^{n}\rightarrow{X}$ is entirely in $A$ or
            in $B$, or both. The proof is similar in technical details
            to excision.
            \begin{theorem}
                If $(X,A)$ is a CW pair, then $A$ has a neighborhood
                $A\subseteq\mathcal{U}\subseteq{X}$ such that $A$ is
                a deformation retract of $\mathcal{U}$.
            \end{theorem}
            \begin{example}
                What is $H_{n}(S^{2}\times{S}^{1})$? Write $S^{2}$ as
                $S_{+}^{2}\cup{S}_{\minus}^{2}$, where
                $S_{\pm}^{2}\simeq{D}^{2}$. Let $A=S_{+}^{2}\times{S}^{1}$
                and $B=S_{\minus}^{2}\times{S}^{1}$. Then $A$ and
                $B$ are solid torii, and $A\cap{B}=S^{1}\times{S}^{1}$,
                which is a torus. If you have a closed, smooth manifold,
                then the highest degree that has homology is the degree
                of the manifold. So, we can start the Mayer-Vietoris
                sequence at 3. But $A\cap{B}$ is a torus, and thus
                $H_{3}(A\cap{B})=0$. Similarly, $H_{3}(A)=H_{3}(B)=0$.
                So, we have:
                \begin{equation}
                    0\rightarrow{H}_{3}(X)\rightarrow
                    H_{2}(S^{1}\times{S}^{1})\rightarrow{H}_{2}(S^{1})
                    \oplus{H}_{2}(S^{1})
                \end{equation}
                But $H_{2}(S^{1}\times{S}^{1})=\mathbb{Z}$, and
                $H_{2}(S^{1})=0$, so we obtain:
                \begin{equation}
                    0\rightarrow{H}_{3}(X)\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}
                    \rightarrow{0}\rightarrow{H}_{2}(X)\rightarrow\cdots
                \end{equation}
                Now $H_{1}(S^{1}\times{S}^{1})=\mathbb{Z}^{2}$, so we
                can simplify further to obtain:
                \begin{equation}
                    0\rightarrow{H}_{2}(X)\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}^{2}
                    \rightarrow{H}_{1}(S^{1})\oplus{H}_{1}(S^{1})
                    \rightarrow{H}_{1}(X)
                \end{equation}
                Thus, $H_{0}(X)=\mathbb{Z}$. Now for $H_{1}$ and $H_{2}$:
                \begin{equation}
                    0\rightarrow{H}_{2}(X)\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}^{2}
                    \rightarrow\mathbb{Z}\oplus\mathbb{Z}\rightarrow
                    H_{1}(X)\rightarrow{0}
                \end{equation}
                We get $H_{1}(X)=H_{2}(X)=\mathbb{Z}$, and thus
                $S^{2}\times{S}^{1}\ne{S}^{3}$.
            \end{example}
        \section{Cohomology}
            Let $G$ be an Abelian group, and let $\mathrm{Hom}$ be a
            functor from Abelian groups to Abelian groups:
            $\mathrm{Hom}(A,G)$ is the set of group homomorphism.
            This is again a group, $(f_{1}+f_{2})(a)=f_{1}(a)+f_{2}(a)$.
            \begin{theorem}
                If $A$, $B$, and $G$ are Abelian groups, then:
                \begin{equation}
                    \mathrm{Hom}(A\oplus{B},G)\simeq
                    \mathrm{Hom}(A,G)\oplus\mathrm{Hom}(B,G)
                \end{equation}
            \end{theorem}
            \begin{theorem}
                If $G$ is an Abelian group, then
                $\mathrm{Hom}(\mathbb{Z},G)\simeq{G}$.
            \end{theorem}
            \begin{proof}
                For let $f\mapsto{f}(1)\in{G}$.
            \end{proof}
            \begin{theorem}
                If $G$ is an Abelian group, and if $m\in\mathbb{N}$,
                then:
                \begin{equation}
                    \mathrm{Hom}(Z^{m},G)\simeq{G}^{m}
                \end{equation}
            \end{theorem}
            $\mathrm{Hom}$ is a functorial contravariant.
            The functorial properties are:
            \begin{subequations}
                \begin{align}
                    \mathrm{id}^{*}&=\mathrm{id}\\
                    (\varphi\psi)^{*}&=\psi^{*}\varphi^{*}\\
                    0^{*}&=0
                \end{align}
            \end{subequations}
            Given any chain complex of Abelian groups with the boundary
            map $\partial^{2}=0$ (Simplicial, singular, cellular, etc.),
            applying the $\mathrm{Hom}$ functor, we get:
            \begin{equation}
                \cdots\leftarrow
                \mathrm{Hom}(C_{n},G)\leftarrow\mathrm{Hom}(C_{n-1},G)
                \leftarrow\mathrm{Hom}(C_{n-2},G)\leftarrow\cdots
            \end{equation}
            With maps $\delta$ called the \textit{coboundary}.
            I $\varphi\in{C}_{n}^{*}=\mathrm{Hom}(C_{n},G)$,
            $\varphi:C_{n}\rightarrow{G}$, then
            $\delta\varphi\in{C}_{n+1}^{*}$.
            $\delta\varphi=\varphi\delta$. The cohomology groups are:
            \begin{equation}
                H^{n}(X,G)=\mathrm{ker}(\delta)/\mathrm{Im}(\delta)
            \end{equation}
        \section{Len's Spaces}
            Take $\mathbb{C}^{n}$, and consider the unit
            sphere $S^{2n-1}\subseteq\mathbb{C}^{n}$. Define
            the map $p$ on $\mathbb{C}^{n}$ by
            $(z_{1},\dots,z_{n})\mapsto%
             (\zeta^{j_{1}}z_{1},\dots,\zeta^{j_{n}}z_{n})$
            Where $\zeta=\exp(2\pi{i}/m$, and
            $0<j_{i}<m$ for all $i$, and furthermore
            $j$ and $m$ are coprime. The lens space is
            $S^{2n-1}/\mathbb{Z}_{m}$, and is denoted
            $L_{m}(j_{1},\dots,j_{n})$. This is the first
            example of two closed manifolds without
            boundary, of the same dimension, that are
            homotopy equivalent, but not homeomorphic.
            For $L_{7}(1,1)$ is homotopy equivalent to
            $L_{7}(1,2)$, but not homeomorphic. The
            homology groups are
            $\mathbb{Z},\mathbb{Z}_{m},0,\mathbb{Z}$, and
            then $0$ for all others. The cohomology is
            $\mathrm{Hom}(G,\mathbb{Z})$, where $G$ are
            the groups from the chain complex from homology.
            We obtain the same sequence, but in reverse.
            Next is the universal coefficient theorem. We
            can compute $H^{n}(X;G)$ from
            $H(X)$ (Singular homology).
            \begin{theorem}
                If $H_{n}(X)\simeq\mathbb{Z}^{m}\oplus{T}_{n}$
                where $T_{n}$ is a torsion group, then:
                \begin{equation}
                    H^{n}(X;\mathbb{Z})\simeq
                    \mathbb{Z}^{m}\oplus{T}_{n-1}
                \end{equation}
            \end{theorem}
            Taking $\mathbb{R}P^{2}$ as an example, the
            homology groups are
            $\mathbb{Z},\mathbb{Z}_{2},0,0,\dots$. Thus, using
            this theorem, the cohomology is
            $\mathbb{Z},0,\mathbb{Z}_{2},0,0,\dots$. As
            another case, if $G=\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{G}$,
            then:
            \begin{equation}
                H_{n}(X;\mathbb{R})\simeq\mathbb{R}^{m}
            \end{equation}
            And also:
            \begin{equation}
                H^{n}(X;\mathbb{R})\simeq\mathbb{R}^{m}
            \end{equation}
            These are dual vector spaces. From UTC, we have:
            \begin{equation}
                H^{1}(X;G)\simeq
                \mathrm{Hom}(H_{1}(X);G)
            \end{equation}
            If $X$ is path-connected, then $H_{1}(X)$ is the
            Abelianization of $\pi_{1}(X)$.
            \begin{ltheorem}{Thom's Theorem}{Thom_Theorem}
                Every $n$ cycle $\xi\in{H}_{n}(X)$ for a
                smooth manifold $X$ is realizable as a
                triangulated oriented submanfiold $M$ of
                dimension $n$, kinda.
            \end{ltheorem}
            This theorem leads to the following idea:
            To define cocycles, we need a procedure that
            assigns elements in $G$ to every $n$ cycle in
            $X$. If $G=\mathbb{R}$, then the integer $k$ from
            Thom's theorem becomes irrelevant. Thom's theorem
            says that it suffices to assign an element in
            $\mathbb{R}$ to every $n$ dimensional submanifold.
            A differential $n$ form $\alpha$ on $X$,
            $X\mapsto{TX}$, where $TX$ is the tangent bundle,
            and $TX\mapsto{T^{*}}X$, where $T^{*}X$ is the
            tangent co-bundle. 
        \section{Cohomology Rings}
            Recall that $H^{\cdot}(X;)$, where $R$ is the coefficient
            ring ($\mathbb{Z},$ $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$, $\mathbb{Q}$,
            $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{C}$, etc.), is the direct product:
            \begin{equation}
                H^{\cdot}(X;R)=\underset{n\in\mathbb{Z}}{\oplus}
                    H^{n(X;R)}
            \end{equation}
            This is the cup product. It is distributive and associative,
            and forms a graded ring. The unit, 1, is the class
            in $\mathrm{Hom}(C_{0}(X);R)$ such that $1(x)=1_{R}$, for
            all $x\in{X}$. There is also a contravariant functor
            from topological spaces to unital graded rings.
            \begin{theorem}
                If $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ is continuous, then there is a
                pullback
                $f^{*}:H^{\cdot}(Y,R)\rightarrow{H}^{\cdot}(X,R)$
                which is a ring homomorphism for these unital graded
                rings.
            \end{theorem}
            The proof comes directly from the various definitions
            involved in the theorem. That is, there are no surprises in
            the proof. The implications are quite strong, however, and
            limit the possibilities.
            \begin{theorem}
                If $\alpha\in{H}^{}(X,R)$ and if
                $\beta\in{H}^{\ell}(X,R)$, if $R$ is a commutative ring,
                then the cohomology ring is graded commutative, that is
                $\alpha\cup\beta=(\minus{1})^{k\ell}\beta\cup\alpha$,
                where $\cup$ is the cup product of $\alpha$ and $\beta$.
            \end{theorem}
            \begin{example}
                Let's compute $H^{\cdot}(\mathbb{T}^{2},\mathbb{Z})$,
                where $\mathbb{T}^{2}=S^{1}\times{S}^{1}$. We'll use
                simplicial homology to do this. Using the planar
                representation, we get the following:
                \begin{subequations}
                    \begin{align}
                        \Delta_{0}&=\mathbb{Z}
                            =\langle{v}\rangle\\
                        \Delta_{1}&=\mathbb{Z}^{3}
                            =\langle{a,b,c}\rangle\\
                        \Delta_{2}&=\mathbb{Z}^{2}
                            =\langle{u,L}\rangle
                    \end{align}
                \end{subequations}
                After magic, we get:
                \begin{subequations}
                    \begin{align}
                        H^{0}&=\mathbb{Z}
                            =\langle{v^{*}}\rangle\\
                        H^{1}&=\mathbb{Z}^{2}
                            =\langle{a^{*}+c^{*},b^{*}+c^{*}}\rangle\\
                        H^{2}&=\mathbb{Z}
                            =\langle{u^{*}}\rangle
                    \end{align}
                \end{subequations}
                WHat is the ring structure? So,
                $H^{\cdot}(\mathbb{T}^{2},\mathbb{Z})$ is generated by
                four elements, and thus we have $\mathbb{Z}^{4}$.
            \end{example}
            \begin{example}
                Consider $H^{\cdot}(\mathbb{RP}^{n},\mathbb{Z}_{2})$.
                We can compute the groups via cellular chain complexes.
                The groups $H^{k}(\mathbb{RP}^{n},\mathbb{Z}_{2})$ are
                isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ for $k=0,\dots,n$.
            \end{example}
            \begin{theorem}[Hatcher, Page 212]
                $H^{\cdot}(\mathbb{RP}^{n},\mathbb{Z}_{2})$, as a
                graded ring, has one generator $x$ and is isomorphic
                to:
                \begin{equation}
                    H^{\cdot}(\mathbb{RP}^{n},\mathbb{Z}_{2})
                    \simeq\mathbb{Z}_{2}[x]/\langle{x^{n+1}}\rangle
                \end{equation}
                Where $x$ has degree 1, $|x|=1$.
            \end{theorem}
        \section{Cap Product}
            The cap product of a ring $R$, the coefficient ring,
            is a thing. $C_{k}(X;R)$ is the singular $k$ chains with
            coefficients in $R$. $C^{\ell}(X;R)$ is the dual complex
            $\mathrm{Hom}(C_{\ell}(X;R)$. The cross product is mapped
            to $C_{k-\ell}(X;R)$ by the cap product. Take a generator
            $\sigma:\Delta^{K}\rightarrow{X}$ and
            $\varphi:C_{\ell}\rightarrow{R}$, and cap them:
            $(\sigma\cap\varphi$. We should then get an element of
            $C_{k-\ell}(X;R)$. We define this by:
            \begin{equation}
                \sigma\cap\varphi
                =\varphi(\sigma|[v_{0},\dots,v_{\ell}])
                    \sigma|[v_{\ell},\dots,v_{k}]
            \end{equation}
            The image of $\varphi$ is an element of $R$, and is simply
            the coefficient. The restriction of $\sigma$ gives another
            map $\Delta^{k-\ell}\rightarrow{X}$. The cap product is well
            defined for cohomology and homology, so the is a map:
            \begin{equation}
                H_{k}(X;R)\times{H}^{\ell}(X;R)\rightarrow
                    H_{k-\ell}(X;R)
            \end{equation}
            Moreover, if $\xi$ is a homology element and $\alpha$ and
            $\beta$ are cohomology elements, then:
            \begin{equation}
                (\xi\cap\alpha)\cap\beta=\xi\cap(\alpha\cup\beta)
            \end{equation}
            In other words:
            \begin{equation}
                H_{\cdot}(X;R)=\underset{j\in\mathbb{Z}}{\oplus}
                    H_{j}(X;R)
            \end{equation}
            Which is a graded module over the graded cohomology ring.
            The same is true in two other theories. The theory of
            bordism and cobordism, as well as in K-Theory
            (K-Homology and H-Theory).
            \begin{ltheorem}{Poincar\'{e} Duality}{Poincare_Duality}
                If $X$ is a closed and oriented manifold that is
                compact and without boundary,
                $[X]\in{H}_{n}(X;\mathbb{R})$ (Fundamental cycle of $X$),
                then homology is a free module over cohomology, with
                generator $[X]$.
            \end{ltheorem}
            If $R$ is a ring, a free module that is finitely generated
            is just copies of $R$: $R^{n}=R\oplus\dots\oplus{R}$. As
            modules, we have an isomorphism:
            $H_{\cdot}(X;\mathbb{R})\simeq{H}^{\cdot}(X;\mathbb{R})$,
            where have the map $\alpha\mapsto[X]\cap\alpha$. Also, from
            the universal coefficient theorem,
            $H^{k}(X;\mathbb{R})\simeq{H}_{k}(X;\mathbb{R})$, and
            $H_{n-k}\simeq{H}_{k}$, ignoring torsion. This can be
            translated to Betti numbers as follows:
            $\beta_{n-k}=\beta_{k}$.
