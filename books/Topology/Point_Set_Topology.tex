    \subsection{Point-Set Topology}
        \begin{definition}
            A topology $\tau$ on a set $X$ is a subset
            of $\mathcal{P}(X)$ such that:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item $\emptyset\subset\tau$ and $X\subset\tau$
                \item For any subset $\mathcal{O}\subset\tau$, the
                      union of all elements of $\mathcal{O}$ is an
                      element of $\tau$.
                \item For any finite subset of $\tau$, the intersection
                      is also an element of $\tau$.
            \end{enumerate}
        \end{definition}
        \begin{definition}
            A topological space, denoted $(X,\tau)$, is a set
            $X$ and a topology $\tau$ on $X$.
        \end{definition}
        Elements of a topological space are called points.
        Elements of the topology are called open subset of $X$.
        A neighborhood of a point $x$ is a set $V$ that contains
        an open subste $U$ such that $x\in{U}$. An open neighborhood
        of $x$ is an open set $U$ such that $x\in{U}$.
        \begin{example}
            The chaotic topology on a set
            $X$ is the set $\tau=\{\emptyset,X\}$.
        \end{example}
        \begin{example}
            The discrete topology on a set $X$ is
            $\tau=\mathcal{P}(X)$.
        \end{example}
        \begin{example}
            The Sierpinski topology
            on $\{0,1\}$ is the set
            $\{\emptyset,\{0\},\{0,1\}\}$.
        \end{example}
        \begin{theorem}
            If $T_{\omega}$ is a set of topologies on
            a topological space $X$, then
            $\bigcap{T_{\omega}}$ is a topology on $X$.
        \end{theorem}
        However, the union of topologies may not be a
        topology. A topology $\tau_{1}$ is set to
        be finer than a topology $\tau_{0}$ if
        $\tau_{0}\subset\tau_{1}$. An accumulation point
        of a set $A$ is a point $x$ such that, for
        all open neighborhoods $U$ of $A$,
        $U\cap{A}\ne\emptyset$.
        \begin{theorem}[Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem]
            If $X$ is a bounded, infinite subset of
            $\mathbb{R}$, then $X$ has at least
            one accumulation point.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{definition}
            The Euclidean topology on
            $\mathbb{R}$ is the set of
            all open sets in the sense that
            $U$ is open if, for all $x\in{U}$,
            there is an $\varepsilon>0$ such
            that $(x-\varepsilon,x+\varepsilon)\subset{U}$.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{definition}
            A closed subset of a topological space
            $(X,\tau)$ is a set $A$ such that
            $A^{C}\in\tau$.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{theorem}
            The intersection of an arbitrary collection of
            closed sets is closed. The union of finitely
            many closed sets is closed.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            Apply DeMorgan's theorem to the properties
            of a topological space $\tau$.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{definition}
            The closure of a set $A$,
            denoted $\overline{A}$, is the
            intersection of all closed sets
            containing $A$.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{theorem}
            If $A$ is a set in a topological space
            $(X,\tau)$, then $A\subset\overline{A}$.
        \end{theorem}
        There's also something called the derived
        set of a set $A$. The interior of $A$
        is the union of all open subset of $A$.
        The boundary of $A$ is the set difference
        of the closure of $A$ and the interior of
        $A$.
        \begin{theorem}
            If $A$ is a set, then
            the interior of $A$ is equal to
            $(\overline{A^{C}})^{C}$
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{definition}
            A dense subset of a topological
            space $(X,\tau)$ is a set $A$
            such that $\overline{A}=X$.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{definition}
            The neighborhood system of a point
            $x$ in a topological space $(X,\tau)$
            is the set of all neighborhoods of
            $x$.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{definition}
            A sequence in a topological space
            $a_{n}$ converges to a point $a$ if,
            for all open neighborhoods $U$ of $a$,
            there is an $N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that,
            for all $n>N$, $a_{n}\in{U}$.
        \end{definition}
        Limits of sequences in topological spaces are NOT
        necessarily unique. This is different from convergence
        in $\mathbb{R}$, where convergence is always unique.
        \begin{definition}
            The relative topology of a
            topological space $(X,\tau)$ with
            respect to a subset $A\subset{X}$
            is $\tau_{A}=\{A\cap{U}:U\in\tau\}$
        \end{definition}
        \begin{theorem}
            If $(X,\tau)$ is a topological space and
            $A\subset{X}$, then
            $(A,\tau_{A})$ is a topological space.
        \end{theorem}
        $(A,\tau_{A})$ is called a subspace of
        $(X,\tau)$.
        \begin{definition}
            A basis of a topological space
            $(X,\tau)$ is a subset $B$ of
            $\tau$ such that every element
            of $\tau$ is the union of some of the
            elements of $B$.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{theorem}
            A subset $B\subset\tau$ is a basis
            for $\tau$ if and only if for all
            $U\in\tau$ and all $x\in{U}$, there is
            a $V\in{B}$ such that
            $x\in{V}\subset{U}$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{theorem}
            If $B$ is a basis of $\tau$, then
            $U$ is open if and only if for all
            $x\in{U}$ there is a $V\in{B}$ such that
            $x\in{V}\subset{U}$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{theorem}
            $\mathbb{R}$ has a countable basis.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            For the set of open intervals
            $(p,q)$, where $p$ and $q$ are rational
            numbers, forms a basis for the standard
            topology on $\mathbb{R}$. Moreover, this
            is countable.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{definition}
            If $(X,\tau)$ is a topological space
            and $S\subset\tau$, then $S$ is a subbase
            if a finite intersection of elements of $S$
            forms a base of $\tau$.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{definition}
            A local base for a point
            $x$ in a topological space $(X,\tau)$
            is a set of open neighborhods $B_{x}$ of
            $x$ such that for all open neighborhoods $G$
            of $x$, there is a $G_{x}\in{B_{x}}$ such that
            $x\in{G_{x}}\subset{G}$.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{theorem}
            If $(X,\tau)$ is a topological space, $x\in{X}$,
            and if $B$ is a base for $\tau$, then
            the set of elements $G_{x}$ in $B$ such that
            $x\in{G_{x}}$ is a local base for $x$.
        \end{theorem}
