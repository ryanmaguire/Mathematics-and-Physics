    \chapter{Topological Spaces}
        We've developed the notions of sets and order, but still cannot talk
        about some of the most fundamental notions that one comes across in
        mathematics and physics. Most notably is that of \textit{continuity}.
        The structure on two lone sets $A$ and $B$ is not enough to describe
        whether or not a function $f:A\rightarrow{B}$ is continuous. To do this
        requires the concept of a \textit{topology}, and from this we get the
        notion of a \textit{topological space}. This chapter aims to define
        topologies and show many examples of such spaces.
