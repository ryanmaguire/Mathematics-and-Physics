                An immersed submanifold is given by an inective immersion
                $f:N\rightarrow{M}$. We write that $(N,f)$ is a submanifold of
                $M$ and usually identify $N$ with $f[N]$. If $f$ is an
                embedding, then we say $(N,f)$ is an embedded submanifold or a
                regular submanifold.

        \begin{fdefinition}{Topological Group}{Topological_Group}
            A topological group is a topological space $\topspace{G}$ with a
            binary operation $*$ such that $\monoid{G}$ is a group and and
            the functions $h:G\times{G}\rightarrow{G}$ and $\nu:G\rightarrow{G}$
            defined by $h(x,y)=x*y$ and $\nu(g)=g^{\minus{1}}$ are continuous.
        \end{fdefinition}
        A topological subgroup of a topological group is a subgroup with the
        subspace topology.
        \begin{fdefinition}{Lie Group}{Lie_Group}
            A Lie group is a smooth manifold $\manifold{G}$ with a binary
            operation $*$ such that $\monoid{G}$ is a group, and the functions
            $h:G\times{G}\rightarrow{G}$ and $\nu:G\rightarrow{G}$ defined by
            $h(x,y)=x*y$ and $\nu(g)=g^{\minus{1}}$ are smooth.
        \end{fdefinition}
        The following question was posed by Hilbert in his famous list of
        problems released at the turn of the $20^{th}$ century. This is known as
        Hilbert's Fifth Problem.
        \begin{equation}
            \begin{split}
                &\text{If }\topgroup{X}\text{ is a topological group such that }
                \topspace{X}\text{ is a topological}\\
                &\text{manifold, then is this a Lie group?}
            \end{split}
        \end{equation}
        The answer is yes, the proof came in the 1950s.
        \begin{fdefinition}{Lie Group Homomorphism}{Lie_Group_Homomorphism}
            A Lie group homomorphism from a Lie group
            $\topgroup[1]{G}$ to a Lie group $\topgroup[2]{G}$ is a smooth
            function $\phi:G_{1}\rightarrow{G}_{2}$ such that $\phi$ is a
            group homomorphism with respect to $\monoid[1]{G}$ and
            $\monoid[2]{G}$.
        \end{fdefinition}
        \begin{theorem}
            If $\topgroup[1]{G}$ and $\topgroup[2]{G}$ are Lie groups and if
            $\phi:G_{1}\rightarrow{G}_{2}$ is a Lie group homomorphism, then
            $\phi$ is a map of constant rank.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            For $a\in{G}_{1}$, let $L_{a}$ be defined by $x\mapsto{a}*x$. This
            is a diffeomorphism.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
            If $\phi:G_{1}\rightarrow{G}_{2}$ is a bijective Lie group
            homomorphism, then it is an isomorphism.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            By the inverse function theorem, together with the fact that the map
            has constant rank.
        \end{proof}
