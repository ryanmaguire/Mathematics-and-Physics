    \begin{solution}
        Consider the sphere obtained from two 0-cells, two 1-cells, and two
        2-cells. That is, we have the north and south pole, two meridians, and
        two hemispheres. Append this with a line connecting the north and south
        pole. Hence we have a CW complex with two 0-cells, three
        1-cells, and two 2-cells. Moreover the line we have attached is a
        contractible subcomplex, and hence if we label this $B$ and the entire
        space $X$, then $X/B$ is homotopy equivalent to $X$. Moreover $X/B$ is
        the same as the quotient of the north and south pole since the entire
        line is collapsed to a point and in the process the poles are joined
        together. Moreover since we are quotienting out a subcomplex, the new
        space inherits a CW structure as well. But homotopy equivalent spaces
        which are path connected have isomorphic fundamental groups for any
        chosen points. We use this to compute $\pi_{1}$ of our space. Starting
        with our sphere with a line connecting the poles, we now quotient out
        one of the meridian lines we've attached. This is again a contractible
        subcomplex, and the result is the wedge of a sphere and a circle
        (See Fig.~\ref{fig:Fig_Prob_Hatcher_1_2_7}). With this we may apply the
        Seifert van-Kampen theorem. Since the fundamental group of the sphere is
        trivial, and since the fundamental group of a circle is isomorphic to
        $\mathbb{Z}$, we have the free product of the trivial group with
        $\mathbb{Z}$, which is just $\mathbb{Z}$. Hence the fundamental group of
        our space is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}$.

        \label{prob:Hatcher_1_2_8}%
        Hatcher 1.2.8
    \end{problem}
    \begin{solution}
        We take as our first open set the entirety of the first torus, plus a
        tiny bit of the the second. Since this can be embedded in $\nspace[3]$
        we may think of this tiny amount as just some union of $\varepsilon$
        neighborhoods whose centers are points on the common circle
        (See Fig.~\ref{fig:Fig_Prob_Hatcher_1_2_8a}). We adopt a similar open set
        containing the second torii. Both of these sets are path connected and
        their intersection contains a small open neighborhood of the common
        circle. We may deformation retract the two open subsets to their main
        torii, and the intersection can be deformation retracted to the common
        circle. Hence by van Kampen's theore we have that the fundamental group
        of the entire space is the amalgamated free product of the two torii
        with respect to the circle. But the fundamental group of the circle is
        $\mathbb{Z}$, and since a torus is the product of two circles the
        fundamental group is $\mathbb{Z}^{2}$. But then, labelling our space $X$
        we obtain:
        \begin{equation}
            \pi_{1}(X,x_{0})=\mathbb{Z}^{2}*_{\mathbb{Z}}\mathbb{Z}^{2}
        \end{equation}

    \begin{problem}
        \label{prob:Hatcher_1_2_9}%
        Hatcher 1.2.9.
    \end{problem}
    \begin{solution}
        If there were such a retraction it would induce an injective
        homomorphism between the fundamental groups of $M_{h}'$ and the circle
        $C$. But then this would further induce an injective homomorphism
        between the Abelianization of $M_{h}'$, the fundamental group of a
        circle being $\mathbb{Z}$ which is already Abelian. But then
        $1\in\mathbb{Z}$ must map to the product of commutators, which is in the
        commutator subgroup of $\pi_{1}(M_{h}')$. But then under the
        Abelianization, which must quotient out by a subgroup which contains the
        commutator subgroup, the entirety of $\mathbb{Z}$ maps to the identity
        element which contradicts injectivity. Hence no such retract exists. If
        we perform this with a circle that does not disconnect the space, then
        there is a retract. First we remove the circle from the surface and then
        rearrange this homeomorphically untill we have a cylindrical object with
        donut holes in it.

        \end{figure}
        We then place an observer inside of this object and project outwards
        from this point onto the enclosing cylinder. This is just the convex
        hull of the bounding circles. We then project the resulting image onto
        one of the circles and then take the composition of the two projections
        described. This results in a retraction from the starting surface onto
        the circle.
