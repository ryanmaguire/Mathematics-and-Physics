    \begin{definition}
        A sequential topological space is a topological space $\topspace{X}$
        such that $\mathcal{U}\subseteq{X}$ is open if and only if $\mathcal{U}$
        is sequentially open. That is, for every sequence
        $a:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow{X}$ with a limit $x\in\mathcal{U}$ there exists
        $N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that for all $n>N$ it is true that
        $a_{n}\in\mathcal{U}$.
    \end{definition}
    We say \textit{a} limit since no separation axioms are assumed, hence limits
    need not be unique. Since CW complexes are Hausdorff this does not cause
    concern.
    \begin{theorem}
        Open implies sequentially open.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        By the definition of convergence. If $a_{n}\rightarrow{x}$, then for
        every open $\mathcal{V}$ containing $x$ there is an $N\in\mathbb{N}$
        such that for all $n>N$ it is true that $a_{n}\in\mathcal{V}$. Setting
        $\mathcal{V}=\mathcal{U}$ gives the result.
    \end{proof}
    \begin{theorem}
        Continuous implies sequentially continuous.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        Standard topological result.
    \end{proof}
    \begin{theorem}
        First countable implies sequential.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        Another standard theorem.
    \end{proof}
    \begin{theorem}
        Metrizable spaces are sequential.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        For metrizable implies first countable, which implies sequential.
    \end{proof}
    \begin{theorem}
        If $\topspace[\alpha]{X_{\alpha}}$ are a collection of sequential
        spaces, if $Y=\coprod_{\alpha}X_{\alpha}$, and if $\tau$ is the
        disjoint union topology, then $\topspace{Y}$ is sequential.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        For suppose $\mathcal{V}\subseteq{Y}$ is sequentially open but not open.
        But $\mathcal{V}$ is open if and only if for all $\alpha$, the pre-image
        under the canonical inclusion mapping
        $\iota_{\alpha}:X_{\alpha}\rightarrow{Y}$ is open. That is,
        $\iota_{\alpha}^{\minus{1}}[\mathcal{V}]$ is open. Hence if
        $\mathcal{V}$ is \textit{not} open, then there exists an $\alpha$ such
        such that $\iota_{\alpha}^{\minus{1}}[\mathcal{V}]\subseteq{X}_{\alpha}$
        is not open. Let $\mathcal{U}=\iota_{\alpha}^{\minus{1}}[\mathcal{V}]$.
        But $X_{\alpha}$ is sequential and hence if $\mathcal{U}$ is not open,
        then it is not sequentially open. But then there is a sequence
        $a:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow{X}_{\alpha}$ with a limit $x\in\mathcal{U}$
        such that for all $N\in\mathbb{N}$ there is an $n>N$ with
        $a_{n}\notin\mathcal{U}$. But $\iota_{\alpha}$ is continuous and hence
        $\iota_{\alpha}(a_{n})\rightarrow\iota_{\alpha}(x)$. But
        $\iota_{\alpha}(x)\in\mathcal{V}$ and $\mathcal{V}$ is sequentially
        continuous. Therefore there is an $N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that for all
        $n>N$ it is true that $\iota_{\alpha}(a_{n})\in\mathcal{V}$. But then
        for all $n>N$, $a_{n}\in\mathcal{U}$, a contradiction. Hence,
        $\mathcal{U}$ is open and $\mathcal{V}$ is also open. That is, $Y$ is
        sequential.
    \end{proof}
    \begin{theorem}[Exercise 2.4G of Engelking's Topology]
        If $\topspace[X]{X}$ and $\topspace[Y]{Y}$ are topological spaces, if
        $X$ is sequential, and if $q:X\rightarrow{Y}$ is a quotient map, then
        $Y$ is sequential.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        For let $\mathcal{V}\subseteq{Y}$ be sequentially open. It suffices to
        prove $\mathcal{V}$ is open. Let
        $\mathcal{U}=q^{\minus{1}}[\mathcal{V}]$ and suppose this is not open.
        But $X$ is sequential and hence $\mathcal{U}$ is not sequentially open.
        But then there is a sequence $a:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow{X}$ with a limit
        $x\in\mathcal{U}$ such that for all $N\in\mathbb{N}$ there is an
        $n\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $n>N$ and $a_{n}\notin\mathcal{U}$. But $q$
        is continuous, and hence sequentially continuous, and therefore
        $q(a_{n})\rightarrow{q}(x)$. But $q(x)\in\mathcal{V}$ and $\mathcal{V}$
        is sequentially open, hence there is an $N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that
        for all $n>N$ it is true that $q(a_{n})\in\mathcal{V}$. But then for
        all $n>N$ we have $a_{n}\in\mathcal{U}$, a contradiction. Hence,
        $\mathcal{U}$ is open. But $\mathcal{V}$ is open if and only if
        $q^{\minus{1}}[\mathcal{V}]$ is open, and therefore $\mathcal{V}$ is
        open. That is, $Y$ is sequential.
    \end{proof}
    \begin{theorem}
        If $\topspace{X}$ is a finite dimensional CW complex, then it is
        sequential.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        We prove by induction on the dimension. The base case $n=0$ is trivially
        true since the disjoint union of points is a discrete space which is
        metrizable, and therefore sequential. Suppose it is true for
        $n\in\mathbb{N}$. If $X$ is an $n+1$ dimensional CW complex then it is
        of the form $X^{n}\coprod{X}^{n+1}/\sim$ where $X^{n}$ is an $n$
        dimensional CW complex, $X^{n+1}$ is the disjoint union of $n+1$
        dimensional closed balls, and $\sim$ is the equivalence relation induced
        by the attaching maps of the $n+1$ skeleton into $X^{n}$. But $X^{n}$ is
        sequential by hypothesis, and $X^{n+1}$ is
        the disjoint union of $n+1$ balls, which is metrizable, and hence
        sequential. But the disjoint union of sequential spaces is sequential,
        and hence $X^{n}\coprod{X}^{n+1}$ is sequential. But then
        $X^{n}\coprod{X}^{n+1}/\sim$ is the quotient of a sequential space, and
        is therefore sequential. Therefore, finite dimensional CW complexes are
        sequential.
    \end{proof}
    \begin{theorem}
        If $X$ is a CW complex, then it is sequential.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        If $X$ is a finite dimensional CW complex, then we are done. So suppose
        not and let $\mathcal{U}\subseteq{X}$ be sequentially open. To show that
        it is open suffices to check that $\mathcal{U}\cap{X}^{n}$ is an open
        subset of $X^{n}$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$. But $X^{n}$ is sequential,
        and hence if $\mathcal{U}\cap{X}^{n}$ is not open, then it is not
        sequentially open. But then there is a sequence
        $a:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow{X}^{n}$ with limit $x\in\mathcal{U}\cap{X}^{n}$
        such that for all $K\in\mathbb{N}$ there is an $k>K$ such that
        $a_{k}\notin\mathcal{U}\cap{X}^{n}$. But $\mathcal{U}$ is sequential,
        hence if $a_{k}\rightarrow{x}$ and $x\in\mathcal{U}$, then there is a
        $K\in\mathbb{N}$ such that for all $k>K$ it is true that
        $a_{k}\in\mathcal{U}$. But for all $k\in\mathbb{N}$ we have
        $a_{k}\in{X}^{k}$ by definition since $a$ is a sequence in $X^{n}$, and
        hence for all $k>K$ we have $a_{k}\in\mathcal{U}\cap{X}^{n}$, a
        contradiction. Therefore $\mathcal{U}\cap{X}^{n}$ is sequentially open,
        and thus open in $X^{n}$. But this is true of all $n\in\mathbb{N}$, and
        hence $\mathcal{U}$ is open.
    \end{proof}
