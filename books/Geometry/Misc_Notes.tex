    \section{Locally Euclidean Spaces}
        We wish to speak about topological spaces that are sufficiently well
        behaved in the sense that it allows one to do calculus. The first
        naive approach is to consider such spaces that can be locally
        approximated by Euclidean space.
        \begin{fdefinition}{Chart}{Chart}
            A chart of dimension $n\in\mathbb{N}$ in a topological space
            $(X,\tau)$, denoted $(\mathcal{U},\varphi)$, is an open set
            $\mathcal{U}\in\tau$ and a function
            $\varphi:\mathcal{U}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n}$ such that
            $\varphi$ is injective, continuous, and an open mapping with
            respect to the standard topology on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$.
        \end{fdefinition}
        Some authors simply denote a chart by the function $\varphi$. Note
        that since the image of $\varphi$ lies in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, if we
        compose with one of the projection mappings $\pi_{k}$ we obtain a
        function $\pi_{k}\circ\phi:\mathcal{U}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$. These
        are called the coordinate functions of the chart
        $(\mathcal{U},\phi)$ and are often denoted $x^{k}=\pi_{k}\circ\phi$.
        Note that we may then write the image of $p\in\mathcal{U}$ as:
        \begin{equation}
            \phi(p)=\big(x^{1}(p),\dots,x^{n}(p)\big)
        \end{equation}
        and such notation is often useful. Avoiding the \textit{dot dot dot}
        notation, we can recall that $\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is a
        function $\mathbf{x}:\mathbb{Z}_{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$. Thus if
        $p\in\mathcal{U}$ and $\mathbf{x}=\phi(p)$, we can write this
        explicitly by:
        \begin{equation}
            \big(\phi(p)\big)(k)=\mathbf{x}(k)=x_{k}=x^{k}(p)
        \end{equation}
        Thus distinguishing the difference between the notation $x^{k}$ and
        $x_{k}$. Here, $x_{k}$ is simply a real number, $x^{k}$ is a function
        $x^{k}:\mathcal{U}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$, and $\mathbf{x}(k)$ is the
        image of $k\in\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ under $\mathbf{x}$. In other words, it is
        the $k^{th}$ component of $\mathbf{x}$.
        \begin{example}
            If $X=\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and $\tau$ is the standard topology, then
            for any open subset $\mathcal{U}\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{n}$ the
            pair $(\mathcal{U},\textrm{id}_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}|_{\mathcal{U}})$
            is a chart, where $\textrm{id}_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}|_{\mathcal{U}}$
            denotes the restriction of the identity map to $\mathcal{U}$.
        \end{example}
        \begin{example}
            If $X=S^{2}$, and if $\tau$ is the subspace topology inherited
            from $\mathbb{R}^{3}$, then we can form a chart around the
            south pole $(0,0,\minus{1})$ as follows. Let
            $\mathcal{U}=S^{2}\setminus\{(0,0,1)\}$. Since $\mathbb{R}^{3}$
            is Hausdorff, and since $S^{2}$ is a subspace of
            $\mathbb{R}^{3}$, it then follows that $S^{2}$ is Hausdorff. But
            if $S^{2}$ is Hausdorff, then the set $\{(0,0,1)\}$ is closed
            since finite sets are closed in a Hausdorff space. But then
            $X\setminus\{(0,0,1)\}$ is the complement of a closed set, and
            thus by definition is open. Hence, $\mathcal{U}$ is an open
            subset of $S^{2}$. We can construct our open mapping
            $\phi:\mathcal{U}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{2}$ by using the
            \textit{stereographic projection}:
            \begin{equation}
                \phi(x,y,z)=\Big(\frac{x}{1-z},\frac{y}{1-z}\Big)
                \quad\quad
                \forall_{(x,y,z)\in{S}^{2}\setminus\{(0,0,1)\}}
            \end{equation}
            This function is continuous and bijective, and has a continuous
            inverse:
            \begin{equation}
                \phi^{\minus{1}}(X,Y)=
                \Big(\frac{2X}{1+X^{2}+Y^{2}},\frac{2Y}{1+X^{2}+Y^{2}},
                    \frac{\minus{1}+X^{2}+Y^{2}}{1+X^{2}+Y^{2}}\Big)
            \end{equation}
            Therefore $\phi$ is a homeomorphism from $\mathcal{U}$ to
            $\mathbb{R}^{2}$, and is thus necessarily a continuous injective
            open mapping. This chart $(\mathcal{U},\phi)$ is actually a
            chart for any point that is not the north pole. If we flip this
            around and do the stereographic projection about the south pole,
            we'll obtain a chart that contains the north pole. Thus the
            sphere can be covered by two charts.
        \end{example}
        \begin{example}
            Another example of a chart on the sphere is the
            \textit{orthographic projection}. The stereographic projection
            is obtain by placing an observer at one of the poles, and
            drawing a straight line from the observer to a point on the
            sphere. This point then gets mapped to $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ by
            finding where this line intersects the $xy$ plane. The
            orthographic is obtained in a similar manner by placing the
            observer \textit{at infinity}. There is now the problem that
            such a straight line intersects the sphere twice: Once on the
            top and once on the bottom. That is, if $(x,y,z)$ lies on this
            line, then so does $(x,y,\minus{z})$. To form our chart we must
            consistently choose either the top or the bottom. Let
            $\mathcal{U}$ be defined as follows:
            \begin{equation}
                \mathcal{U}=\{(x,y,z)\in{S}^{2}\;|\;z>0\}
            \end{equation}
            Define the orthographic projection by:
            \begin{equation}
                \phi(x,y,z)=(x,y)
            \end{equation}
            This is a homeomorphism between $\mathcal{U}$ and the open unit
            disc $B_{1}(0)$. The inverse function is:
            \begin{equation}
                \phi^{\minus{1}}(X,Y)=\big(X,Y,\sqrt{1-X^{2}-Y^{2}}\big)
            \end{equation}
            where we unambiguously take the positive square root. This is
            a chart for any point in the upper hemisphere (the equator is
            not included). To completely cover the sphere using orthographic
            projections requires 6 charts ($\pm{x}$, $\pm{y}$, $\pm{z}$,
            our open set $\mathcal{U}$ corresponding to $+z$).
        \end{example}
        Equivalently, one could say that $\phi$ is a homeomorphism between
        $\mathcal{U}$ and it's image under $\phi$. That is,
        $\phi(\mathcal{U})\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is homeomorphic to
        $\mathcal{U}$ and $\phi:\mathcal{U}\rightarrow\phi(\mathcal{U})$ is
        a homeomorphism.
        \begin{theorem}
            If $(X,\tau)$ is a topological space, if $n\in\mathbb{N}$, if
            $(\mathcal{U},\phi)$ is a chart in $(X,\tau)$, and if
            $\mathcal{V}=\phi(\mathcal{U})$ is the image of $\mathcal{U}$
            under $\phi$, then $\phi:\mathcal{U}\rightarrow\mathcal{V}$ is
            a homeomorphism.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            For since $(\mathcal{U},\phi)$ is a chart, $\phi$ is injective,
            continuous, and an open mapping. But since $\mathcal{V}$ is the
            image of $\mathcal{U}$ under $\phi$, the restriction
            $\phi:\mathcal{U}\rightarrow\mathcal{V}$ is therefore
            surjective. But then $\phi:\mathcal{U}\rightarrow\mathcal{V}$ is
            both injective and surjective, and is therefore bijective. But
            since $\phi$ is an open mapping, $\phi^{\minus{1}}$ is
            continuous. But then $\phi$ is a continuous bijection with a
            continuous inverse and is thus a homeomorphism.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{fdefinition}{Locally Euclidean Space}
                           {Locally Euclidean Space}
            A locally Euclidean space is a topological space $(X,\tau)$
            such that for all $x\in{X}$ there exists an $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and
            an $n$ dimensional chart $(\mathcal{U},\phi)$ of $(X,\tau)$ such
            that $x\in\mathcal{U}$.
        \end{fdefinition}
        This is the most general setting for one to define a manifold. The
        dimension of a locally Euclidean space need not be constant, for we
        can consider the disjoint union of a sphere with a line. Thus there
        will be 2 dimensional points and 1 dimensional points. Dimension is,
        however, a locally constant property. In particular, for any fixed
        point $x\in{X}$ there is only one $n\in\mathbb{N}$ such that
        $x$ is locally like $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. If in addition the space
        $(X,\tau)$ is connected, then there is only one unambiguous number
        $n\in\mathbb{N}$ such that every point $x\in{X}$ is locally like
        $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. This allows us to define dimension.
        \begin{theorem}
            If $X$ and $Y$ are sets, if $\mathcal{U}\subseteq{X}$, if
            $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ is a function, if
            $f|_{\mathcal{U}}:\mathcal{U}\rightarrow{f}(\mathcal{U})$ is the
            restriction of $f$ to $\mathcal{U}$, and if
            $\mathcal{V}\subseteq{f}(\mathcal{U})$, then:
            \begin{equation}
                f|_{\mathcal{U}}^{\minus{1}}(\mathcal{V})
                =\mathcal{U}\cap{f}^{\minus{1}}(\mathcal{V})
            \end{equation}
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            For if $x\in{f}|_{\mathcal{U}}^{\minus{1}}(\mathcal{V})$, then
            there is an $x\in\mathcal{U}$ such that
            $f|_{\mathcal{U}}(x)\in\mathcal{V}$. But for all
            $x\in\mathcal{U}$ it is true that $f|_{\mathcal{U}}(x)=f(x)$,
            and thus $f(x)\in\mathcal{V}$. But if $f(x)\in\mathcal{V}$, then
            $x\in{f}^{\minus{1}}(\mathcal{V})$. Thus $x\in\mathcal{U}$ and
            $x\in{f}^{\minus{1}}(\mathcal{V})$, and therefore
            $x\in\mathcal{U}\cap{f}^{\minus{1}}(\mathcal{V})$. So we obtain:
            \begin{equation}
                f|_{\mathcal{U}}^{\minus{1}}(\mathcal{V})
                \subseteq\mathcal{U}\cap{f}^{\minus{1}}(\mathcal{V})
            \end{equation}
            In the other direction, if
            $x\in\mathcal{U}\cap{f}^{\minus{1}}(\mathcal{V})$, then
            $x\in\mathcal{U}$ and $f(x)\in\mathcal{V}$. But if
            $x\in\mathcal{U}$, then $f(x)=f|_{\mathcal{U}}(x)$ and therefore
            $f|_{\mathcal{U}}(x)\in\mathcal{V}$. But then
            $x\in{f}|_{\mathcal{U}}^{\minus{1}}(\mathcal{V})$. That is:
            \begin{equation}
                \mathcal{U}\cap{f}^{\minus{1}}(\mathcal{V})
                \subseteq{f}|_{\mathcal{U}}^{\minus{1}}(\mathcal{V})
            \end{equation}
            From the definition of equality, we are done.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
            If $(X,\tau_{X})$ and $(Y,\tau_{Y})$ are topological spaces,
            if $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ is a homeomorphism, and if
            $\mathcal{U}\subseteq{X}$, then the restriction
            $f|_{\mathcal{U}}:\mathcal{U}\rightarrow{f}(\mathcal{U})$ is
            a homeomorphism between $(\mathcal{U},\tau_{X}|_{\mathcal{U}})$
            and $(f(\mathcal{U}),\tau_{Y}|_{f(\mathcal{U})})$, where
            $\tau_{X}|_{\mathcal{U}}$ and $\tau_{Y}|_{f(\mathcal{U})}$ are
            the subspace topologies.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            Since $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ is a homeomorphism it is therefore
            bijective. But then
            $f|_{\mathcal{U}}:\mathcal{U}\rightarrow{f}(\mathcal{U})$ is
            bijective. For if not, then it is either not injective or not
            surjective. But if it is not injective then there exists points
            $x_{1},x_{2}\in\mathcal{U}$ such that $x_{1}\ne{x}_{2}$ and
            $f|_{\mathcal{U}}(x_{1})=f|_{\mathcal{U}}(x_{2})$. But since
            $f|_{\mathcal{U}}$ is the restriction of $f$ to $\mathcal{U}$,
            for all $x\in\mathcal{U}$ it is true that
            $f(x)=f|_{\mathcal{U}}(x)$. But $x_{1},x_{2}\in\mathcal{U}$ and
            thus $f(x_{1})=f|_{\mathcal{U}}(x_{1})$ and similary for
            $x_{2}$. Then by the transitivity of equality,
            $f(x_{1})=f(x_{2})$, a contradiction since $f$ is injective.
            Therefore $f|_{\mathcal{U}}$ is injective. It is surjective by
            the definition of the image of $\mathcal{U}$ under $f$. Thus,
            $f|_{\mathcal{U}}:\mathcal{U}\rightarrow{f}(\mathcal{U})$ is
            bijective. If $\mathcal{V}\subseteq{f}(\mathcal{U})$ is open in
            the subspace topology then there is an open set
            $\mathcal{O}\in\tau_{Y}$ such that
            $\mathcal{V}=\mathcal{O}\cap{f}(\mathcal{U})$. But then:
            \begin{subequations}
                \begin{align}
                    f|_{\mathcal{U}}^{\minus{1}}(\mathcal{V})
                    &=\mathcal{U}\cap{f}^{\minus{1}}(\mathcal{V})\\
                    &=\mathcal{U}\cap
                        f^{\minus{1}}\big(
                            f(\mathcal{U})\cap\mathcal{O}
                        \big)\\
                    &=\mathcal{U}\cap\Big(
                        f^{\minus{1}}\big(f(\mathcal{U})\big)\cap
                        f^{\minus{1}}(\mathcal{O})
                    \Big)\\
                    &=\mathcal{U}\cap\big(
                        \mathcal{U}\cap{f}^{\minus{1}}(\mathcal{O})\big)\\
                    &=\big(\mathcal{U}\cap\mathcal{U})\cap
                        f^{\minus{1}}(\mathcal{O})\\
                    &=\mathcal{U}\cap{f}^{\minus{1}}(\mathcal{O})
                \end{align}
            \end{subequations}
            But $f$ is continuous and therefore $f^{\minus{1}}(\mathcal{O})$
            is an open subset of $X$. But then
            $\mathcal{U}\cap{f}^{\minus{1}}(\mathcal{O})$ is open in the
            subspace topology $\tau_{X}|_{\mathcal{U}}$, and therefore
            $f|_{\mathcal{U}}$ is continuous. In a similar manner,
            $f|_{\mathcal{U}}^{\minus{1}}$ is continuous and therefore
            $f|_{\mathcal{U}}$ is a homeomorphism.
        \end{proof}
        While we were very liberal in our definition of a locally Euclidean
        space, allowing the set $\mathcal{V}\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{n}$ to be
        any open set, we need not be. A topological space is locally
        Euclidean if and only if every point has an open neighborhood that
        is homeomorphic to all of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$.
        \begin{theorem}
            If $(X,\tau)$ is a topological space, $x\in{X}$, if
            $n\in\mathbb{N}$, and if $(\mathcal{U},\phi)$ is an $n$
            dimensional chart in $(X,\tau)$ such that $x\in\mathcal{U}$,
            then there is an open subset $\mathcal{V}\in\tau$ such that
            $x\in\mathcal{V}$ and $\mathcal{V}$ is homeomorphic to
            $\mathbb{R}^{n}$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
                For since $\phi:\mathcal{U}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is an open
                mapping, $\phi(\mathcal{U})$ is an open subset of
                $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. But if $x\in\mathcal{U}$, then
                $\phi(x)\in\phi(\mathcal{U})$. But if $\mathcal{U}$ is open and
                if $\phi(x)\in\phi(\mathcal{U})$, then there is an $r>0$ such
                that the open ball of radius $r$ about $\phi(x)$ is contained in
                $\phi(\mathcal{U})$. That is,
                $B_{r}(\phi(x),\mathbb{R}^{n})\subseteq\phi(\mathcal{U})$. But
                since $B_{r}(\phi(x),\mathbb{R}^{n})\subseteq\phi(\mathcal{U})$,
                we have:
                \begin{equation}
                    \phi^{\minus{1}}\big(B_{r}(\phi(x),\mathbb{R}^{n})\big)
                    \subseteq\mathcal{U}
                \end{equation}
                But then since $B_{r}(\phi(x),\mathbb{R}^{n})$ is contained in
                the image of $\mathcal{U}$ under $\phi$, we have:
                \begin{equation}
                    \phi\Big(
                        \phi^{\minus{1}}\big(B_{r}(\phi(x_,\mathbb{R}^{n})\big)
                    \Big)
                    =B_{r}(\phi(x),\mathbb{R}^{n})
                \end{equation}
                But then the restriction of $\phi$ to
                $\phi^{\minus{1}}\big(B_{r}(\phi(x),\mathbb{R}^{n})\big)$ is a
                homeomorphism from
                $\phi^{\minus{1}}\big(B_{r}(\phi(x),\mathbb{R}^{n})\big)$ to
                $B_{r}(\phi(x),\mathbb{R}^{n})$. But
                $B_{r}(\phi(x),\mathbb{R}^{n})$ is homeomorphic to
                $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, and since homeomorphic is an equivalence
                relation, we have that
                $\phi^{\minus{1}}\big(B_{r}(\phi(x),\mathbb{R}^{n})\big)$ is
                homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. But then
                $\phi^{\minus{1}}\big(B_{r}(\phi(x),\mathbb{R}^{n})\big)$ is an
                open subset of $X$ that contains $x$ and is homeomorphic to
                $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, completing the proof.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
                If $(X,\tau)$ is a topological space, if $Y$ is a set with at
                least two points, and if for all locally constant functions
                $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ it is true that $f$ is constant, then
                $(X,\tau)$ is connected.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
                For suppose not. Then there are non-empty disjoint open subsets
                $\mathcal{U},\mathcal{V}\in\tau$ that partition $X$. That is,
                $\mathcal{U}\cap\mathcal{V}=\emptyset$ and
                $\mathcal{U}\cup\mathcal{V}=X$. Since $Y$ has at least two
                points, there are distinct $y_{1},y_{2}\in{Y}$. Let
                $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ be defined as follows:
                \begin{equation}
                    f(x)=
                    \begin{cases}
                        y_{1},&x\in\mathcal{U}\\
                        y_{2},&x\in\mathcal{V}
                    \end{cases}
                \end{equation}
                Then $f$ is locally constant. That is, since $\mathcal{U}$ and
                $\mathcal{V}$ partition $X$, for all $z\in{X}$ it is true that
                either $z\in\mathcal{U}$ or $z\in\mathcal{V}$, but not both.
                Thus suppose there is a $z\in{X}$ such that for all
                $\mathcal{O}\in\tau$ such that $z\in\mathcal{O}$ it is not true
                that $f$ is constant on $\mathcal{O}$. But either
                $z\in\mathcal{U}$ or $z\in\mathcal{V}$. If $z\in\mathcal{U}$,
                then for all $x\in\mathcal{U}$, $f(x)=y_{1}$ and thus $f$ is
                locally constant on $\mathcal{U}$. Similarly if
                $z\in\mathcal{V}$, and thus $f$ is locally constant. It is not
                constant since $\mathcal{U}$ and $\mathcal{V}$ are non-empty,
                and thus $f(X)=\{y_{1},y_{2}\}$, which is not a singleton. A
                contradiction since by hypothesis for all locally constant
                functions $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ it is true that $f$ is constant.
                Therefore, $(X,\tau)$ is connected.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
                If $(X,\tau)$ is a connected topological space, if $Y$ is a set,
                and if $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ is locally constant, then $f$ is
                constant.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
                For suppose not. Then there is a function $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$
                that is locally constant but not constant. But if $f$ is not
                constant, then there are distinct $y_{1},y_{2}\in{Y}$ such that
                $f^{\minus{1}}\{y_{1}\}\ne\emptyset$ and similarly for $y_{2}$.
                Define $\mathcal{U}$ as follows:
                \begin{equation}
                    \mathcal{U}=f^{\minus{1}}\big(\{y_{1}\}\big)
                \end{equation}
                Since $f$ is locally constant, for all $x\in\mathcal{U}$ there
                exists an open subset $\mathcal{V}_{x}\in\tau$ such that
                $x\in\mathcal{V}_{x}$ and $f$ is constant on $\mathcal{V}_{x}$.
                But since $x\in\mathcal{U}$, for all $z\in\mathcal{V}_{x}$ it
                must be true that $f(z)=y_{1}$. But then:
                \begin{equation}
                    \mathcal{U}=
                    \bigcup_{x\in\mathcal{U}}\mathcal{V}_{x}
                \end{equation}
                Since $\mathcal{U}$ is the union of open sets, it must be open
                itself. In a similarly manner, $X\setminus\mathcal{U}$ is open.
                But $X\setminus\mathcal{U}$ is non-empty since
                $f^{\minus{1}}(\{y_{2}\})\subseteq{X}\setminus\mathcal{U}$
                and $f^{\minus{1}}(\{y_{2}\})$ is non-empty. But then
                $\mathcal{U}$ and $X\setminus\mathcal{U}$ are non-empty disjoint
                open sets that partition $X$, and therefore $(X,\tau)$ is
                disconnected, a contradiction. Therefore, $f$ is constant.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
                If $(X,\tau)$ is a topological space, if $x\in{X}$, if
                $m,n\in\mathbb{N}$, if $(\mathcal{U},\varphi)$ and
                $(\mathcal{V},\psi)$ are $m$ and $n$ dimensional charts,
                respectively, and if $x\in\mathcal{U}$ and $x\in\mathcal{V}$,
                then $n=m$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
                For suppose not. Since $\mathcal{U}$ and $\mathcal{V}$ are open,
                $\mathcal{U}\cap\mathcal{V}$ is open. But $x\in\mathcal{U}$ and
                $x\in\mathcal{V}$, and thus $\mathcal{U}\cap\mathcal{V}$ is
                non-empty. But since
                $\varphi:\mathcal{U}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{m}$ and
                $\psi:\mathcal{V}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n}$ are open mappings,
                $\psi\circ\varphi^{\minus{1}}:%
                 \varphi(\mathcal{U}\cap\mathcal{V})\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n}$
                is an open mapping. But since $\mathcal{U}\cap\mathcal{V}$ is
                open, and since $\varphi$ is an open mapping,
                $\varphi(\mathcal{U}\cap\mathcal{V})$ is an open subset of
                $\mathbb{R}^{m}$. But then $\varphi(\mathcal{U}\cap\mathcal{V})$
                is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^{m}$ that is homeomorphic to
                $\psi(\mathcal{U}\cap\mathcal{V})$, which is an open subset
                of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. But then by invariance of domain, $n=m$.
        \end{proof}
        With this we can define a function
        $\textrm{dim}:X\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$ from any locally Euclidean
        topological space $(X,\tau)$ called the \textit{dimension} function.
        Our current goal is to show that this function is locally constant.
        \begin{theorem}
                If $(X,\tau)$ is a locally Euclidean topological space, if
                $\textrm{dim}:X\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$ is the function such that
                for all $x\in{X}$, $\textrm{dim}(x)$ is the unique
                $n\in\mathbb{N}$ such that there exists a chart
                $(\mathcal{U},\varphi)$ of dimension $n$ such that
                $x\in\mathcal{U}$, then $\textrm{dim}$ is locally constant.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
                For suppose not. Then there is a point $x\in{X}$ such that for
                all $\mathcal{U}\in\tau$ such that $x\in\mathcal{U}$, it is not
                true that $f$ is constant on $\mathcal{U}$. But since $(X,\tau)$
                is locally Euclidean, there is an $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and a chart
                $(\mathcal{U},\phi)$ of dimension $n$ such that
                $x\in\mathcal{U}$. But for all $z\in\mathcal{U}$,
                $(\mathcal{U},\phi)$ is a chart of dimension $n$ that contains
                $z$. But the dimension is pointwise invariant, and thus the
                dimension is constant on $\mathcal{U}$, a contradiction. Thus,
                dimension is a locally constant function.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
                If $(X,\tau)$ is a connected locally Euclidean topological
                space, then the dimension is constant.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
                For dimension is locally constant, and locally constant
                functions on a connected topological space are constant.
        \end{proof}
    \section{Homogeneous Spaces}
        \begin{fdefinition}{Homogeneous Topological Space}
                               {Homogeneous_Topological_Space}
                A homogeneous topological space is a topological space
                $(X,\tau)$ such that for all $x,y\in{X}$ there exists a
                homeomorphism $f:X\rightarrow{X}$ such that $f(x)=y$.
        \end{fdefinition}
        Homogeneous spaces are ones where any point $x$ looks locally like
        any other point.
        \begin{example}
                For any $n\in\mathbb{N}$, the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
                is homogeneous. Given $\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\in\mathbb{R}^{n}$,
                define $f:\mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n}$ by:
                \begin{equation}
                    f(\mathbf{z})=\mathbf{y}+(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{z})
                \end{equation}
                Then $f(\mathbf{x})=\mathbf{y}$, as desired. This is bijective
                and bicontinuous, and therefore a homeomorphism. Indeed, by
                invariance of domain it suffices to show that $f$ is bijective
                and continuous. The fact that $f^{\minus{1}}$ is continuous then
                comes for free.
        \end{example}
        \begin{example}
                If $X=S^{n}$, $n>1$, then $S^{n}$ is homogeneous. Given two
                points $\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\in{S}^{n}$, let $R$ be the
                rotation mapping that takes $\mathbf{x}$ to $\mathbf{y}$. This
                is bijective and bicontinuous, and hence a homeomorphism. For
                the case of $n=0$, $S^{0}$ is merely two points and the topology
                is the power set. Letting $f$ be the function that swaps these
                two points shows that $S^{0}$ is also homogeneous.
        \end{example}
        Not every space is homogeneous. We'll need a brief discussion on
        ordered spaces to demonstrate this.
        \begin{definition}
                The order topology from a totally ordered set $(X,\leq)$ is
                the topology $\tau$ generated by sets of the form:
                \begin{equation}
                    (a,b)=\{\,x\in{X}\;|\;a<x\textrm{ and }x<b\,\}
                \end{equation}
                together with open rays:

        \begin{example}
                The standard topology on $\mathbb{R}$ is an order topology
                induced by the standard order. The long line is another such
                topology induced by the lexicographic ordering on
                $[0,1)\times\omega_{1}$, where $\omega_{1}$ is the first
                uncountable ordinal.

                A complete totally ordered set is a totally ordered set
                $(X,\leq)$ with the least upper bound property.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{theorem}
                If $(X,\leq)$ is a totally ordered set, if $\tau$ is the order
                topology, and if $(X,\tau)$ is connected, then $(X,\leq)$ is
                a complete totally ordered set.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
                For suppose not. Then there exists a set
                $\mathcal{U}\subseteq{X}$ that is bounded above that contains
                no least upper bound. Let $\mathcal{V}_{+}$ be defined as
                follows:
                \begin{equation}
                    \mathcal{V}_{+}=\{\,x\in{X}\;|\;
                        \forall_{y\in\mathcal{U}}(y<x)\,\}
                \end{equation}
                Since $\mathcal{U}$ is bounded above, $\mathcal{V}_{+}$ is
                non-empty. Moreover, it is open since:
                \begin{equation}
                    \mathcal{V}_{+}=
                    \bigcup_{x\in\mathcal{V}_{+}}(x,\infty)
                \end{equation}
                For if $x_{0}\in\bigcup(x,\infty)$ then there is an
                $x\in\mathcal{V}_{+}$ such that $x_{0}\in(x,\infty)$. But
                for all $y\in\mathcal{U}$ it is true that $y<x$, and thus by
                transitivity $y<x_{0}$. Thus, by definition,
                $x_{0}\in\mathcal{V}_{+}$. Now if $x_{0}\in\mathcal{V}_{+}$,
                suppose it is not in $\bigcup(x,\infty)$. Then for all
                $x\in\mathcal{V}_{+}$ it is true that $x_{0}<x$, or $x=x_{0}$,
                and thus $x_{0}$ is a greatest lower bound of $\mathcal{V}_{+}$.
                But by construction, $x_{0}$ is then a least upper bound of
                $\mathcal{U}$, but $\mathcal{U}$ has no such thing. Thus
                $x_{0}\in\bigcup(\minus\infty,x)$, and hence we have equality.
                Thus $\mathcal{V}_{+}$ is open. By a similar argument,
                ${X}\setminus\mathcal{V}_{+}$ is open, and hence $X$ is
                disconnected, a contradiction. Thus, $(X,\leq)$ is complete.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
                If $(X,\leq)$ is a totally ordered set, if $\tau$ is the order
                topology, if $\mathcal{U}$ is a connected subset of $X$, and if
                $a,b\in\mathcal{U}$ are such that $a<b$, then
                $(a,b)\subseteq\mathcal{U}$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
                Suppose not. Then there is a $c\in(a,b)$ such that
                $c\notin\mathcal{U}$. But then $(c,\infty)\cap\mathcal{U}$ and
                $(\minus\infty,c)\cap\mathcal{U}$ are disjoint non-empty subsets
                that are open in $\mathcal{U}$, and hence $\mathcal{U}$ is
                disconnected, a contradiction.

                If $(X,<_{X})$ and $(Y,<_{Y})$ are totally ordered sets, if
                $\tau_{X}$ and $\tau_{Y}$ are the order topologies on $X$ and
                $Y$, respectively, if $(X,\tau_{X})$ is a connected topological
                topological space, if $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ is a continuous
                function, and if $a,b\in{X}$ are such that $a<_{X}b$ and
                $f(a)<_{Y}f(b)$, then for all $c\in(f(a),f(b))$ there is an
                $x_{0}\in(a,b)$ such that $f(x_{0})=c$.
        \end{ltheorem}
        \begin{proof}
                For the continuous image of a connected set is connected, and
                thus $f\big([a,b]\big)$ is a connected subset of $Y$. But
                $f(a)\in{f}\big([a,b]\big)$ and $f(b)\in{f}\big([a,b]\big)$ and
                since $f\big([a,b]\big)$ is connected we have that
                $\big(f(a),f(b)\big)\subseteq{f}\big([a,b]\big)$. But then for
                all $c\in\big(f(a),f(b)\big)$ it is true that
                $c\in{f}\big((a,b)\big)$, and thus there is an $x_{0}\in(a,b)$
                such that $f(x_{0})=c$.

        \begin{theorem}
                If $(X,\leq)$ is a totally ordered set, if $\tau$ is the order
                topology, if $(X,\tau)$ is connected, and if $f:X\rightarrow{X}$
                is a homeomorphism, then either $f$ is order preserving or
                order reversing.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
                For suppose not. Then there are $a,b,c\in{X}$ such that
                $a<b$ and $b<c$, yet either $f(b)<f(a)$ and $f(b)<f(c)$, or
                $f(a)<f(b)$ and $f(c)<f(b)$. Suppose $f(a)<f(b)$ and
                $f(c)<f(b)$. Since $a<b$ and $b<c$, by transitivity $a<c$, and
                thus $a\ne{c}$. Furthermore, since $f$ is a homeomorphism it is
                bijective, and therefore injective, and thus $f(a)\ne{f}(c)$.
                But $\leq$ is a total ordering and thus by trichotomy either
                $f(a)<f(c)$ or $f(c)<f(a)$. Suppose $f(a)<f(c)$. But since
                $f(a)<f(c)$ and $f(c)<f(b)$, and thus
                $f(c)\in\big(f(a),f(b)\big)$. But then by the intermediate value
                theorem there is an $x_{0}\in(a,b)$ such that $f(x_{0})=f(c)$.
                But if $x_{0}\in(a,b)$, then $x_{0}<b$. But $b<c$, and therefore
                $x_{0}<c$ and hence $x_{0}\ne{c}$. But then $f(x_{0})=f(c)$ and
                $x_{0}\ne{c}$, contradicting the fact that $f$ is a bijection,
                a contradiction. Similarly, it is not true that $f(b)<f(a)$ and
                $f(b)<f(c)$. Thus, either $f$ is order preserving or order
                reversing.
        \end{proof}
        We can now prove that there are non-homogeneous spaces.
        \begin{example}
                Let $X=(0,1]$, with the standard subspace topology inherited
                from $\mathbb{R}$. This is the same as the order topology from
                the standard ordering. Suppose $(0,1]$ is homogeneous and let
                $x=1$, $y=1/2$. Then there is a homeomorphism
                $f:X\rightarrow{X}$ such that $f(1)=1/2$. But any homeomorphism
                must be order preserving or order reserving, and since
                $1\geq{x}$ for all $x\in(0,1]$, either $f(1)\geq{x}$ for all
                $x$, or $f(1)\leq{x}$ for all $x$. But it $f(1)\leq{x}$ for all
                $x$ then $f(1)$ is a greatest lower bound, but $(0,1]$ has no
                such bound. Hence, $f(1)\geq{x}$ for all $x\in{X}$. But then
                $f(1)=1$, a contradiction since $f(1)=1/2$. Hence, $(0,1]$ is
                not homogeneous.
        \end{example}
        The next theorem to prove is that any connected Hausdorff locally
        Euclidean topological space is homogeneous.
        \begin{theorem}
                If $(X,\tau)$ is a connected Hausdorff locally Euclidean
                topological space, then it is homogeneous.
        \end{theorem}
        If the Hausdorff property is lost we may lose the homogeneity of the
        space as well. The fact that locally Euclidean spaces can be
        non-Hausdorff is one justification for including the Hausdorff
        property in the definition of a topological manifold, which is a
        locally Euclidean Hausdorff topological space that is second
        countable. First we'll demonstrate the existence of non-Hausdorff
        locally Euclidean topological spaces.
        \begin{example}
                Let $X$ be the disjoint union of $\mathbb{R}$ with itself:
                \begin{equation}
                    X=\mathbb{R}\sqcup\mathbb{R}
                \end{equation}
                That is, $X=(\mathbb{R}\times\{0\})\cup(\mathbb{R}\times\{1\})$.
                Furthermore, consider the relation $R'\subseteq{X}\times{X}$
                defined by:
                \begin{equation}
                    R'=\Big\{\,\Big((x,a),(x,b)\Big)\;\Big|\;
                        x\in\mathbb{R}\setminus\{0\}
                        \textrm{ and }a,b\in\mathbb{Z}_{2}\,\Big\}
                \end{equation}
                That is, $(x,a)R'(y,b)$ if and only if $a,b\in\{0,1\}$, and
                $x=y$ are non-zero. From this we can obtain an equivalence
                relation $R$ as follows:
                \begin{equation}
                    R=R'\cup\big\{\big((0,0),(0,0)\big\}\cup
                        \big\{\big((0,1),(0,1)\big\}
                \end{equation}
                That is, $R$ is the reflexive closure of $R'$. This is an
                equivalence relation. Let $Y$ be the topological space
                $(X/R,\tau_{R})$, where $\tau_{R}$ is the quotient topology.
                This space is then locally Euclidean. For if $x\ne{0}$, let
                $r=|x|/2$ Let $\mathcal{U}$ be defined by:
                \begin{equation}
                    \mathcal{U}=\big\{[(y,0)]\in{X}\;|\;|y-x|<r\big\}
                \end{equation}
                Then $\mathcal{U}$ is open since for all points
                $[z]\in\mathcal{U}$, either $z=(y,0)$ or $z=(y,1)$ where
                $|x-y|<r$. By the triangle inequality we can then conclude that
                $y\ne{0}$. But then:
                \begin{equation}
                    \bigcup\mathcal{U}=\Big(B_{r}^{\mathbb{R}}(x)\times\{0\}\Big)
                        \bigcup\Big(B_{r}^{\mathbb{R}}(x)\times\{1\}\Big)
                \end{equation}
                And this is an open subset of $X$ with the disjoint union
                topology, and therefore $\mathcal{U}$ is open in the quotient
                topology. We can define a homemorphism between $\mathcal{U}$ and
                the open interval $(x-r,x+r)$ by defining:
                \begin{equation}
                    \phi\big([(y,0)]\big)=y
                \end{equation}
                Similarly, for the points $(0,0)$ and $(0,1)$ we can define
                $\mathcal{U}_{0}=X\setminus\{[(0,1)]\}$ and
                $\mathcal{U}_{1}=X\setminus\{[0,0]\}$, both of which are
                homeomorphic to all of $\mathbb{R}$. Thus this space, which is
                called the \textit{bug-eyed line}\index{Bug-Eyed Line}, or the
                \textit{line with two origins}\index{Line with Two Origins}, is
                locally Euclidean but is not Hausdorff since every open set
                containing $(0,0)$ and every open set containing $(0,1)$ have
                non-empty intersection.
        \end{example}
        The bug-eyed line\index{Bug-Eyed Line} is shown in
        Fig.~\ref{fig:Bug_Eyed_Line}. The dashed line is used to denote that
        this final sketch is approximately what the space \textit{looks}
        like. We can use this figure to show that any open set containing
        the upper origin must also contain the lower one
        (see Fig.~\ref{fig:Open_Neighborhoods_of_Origins_in_Bug_Eyed_Line}).
        \begin{example}
                The bug-eyed line is not homogeneous. For the points $(0,0)$ and
                $[(1,0)]$ can be separated by open sets, as can the points
                $(0,1)$ and $[(1,0)]$. However $(0,0)$ can not be be separated
                from $(0,1)$, and since homeomorphisms preserve the Hausdorff
                property, there can be no such function $f:X\rightarrow{X}$ such
                that $f\big((0,0)\big)=[(1,0)]$. Hence, the bug-eyed line is
                not homogeneous.
        \end{example}
        \begin{figure}[H]
                \centering
                \captionsetup{type=figure}
                \input{tikz/Bug_Eyed_Line_Construction.tex}
                \caption{Construction of the Bug-Eyed Line}

                \label{fig:Open_Neighborhoods_of_Origins_in_Bug_Eyed_Line}
        \end{figure}
        Another common example of a non-Hausdorff locally Euclidean space is
        the branching line. This is defined in a similar manner as the
        bug-eyed line, but with a slightly different equivalence relation.
        We define $R$ by:
        \begin{equation}
                R=\big\{\,\big((x,a),(x,b)\big)\;|\;
                    x<0\textrm{ and }a,b\in\mathbb{Z}_{2}\big\}
        \end{equation}
        We then look at the reflexive closure of $R$, adding
        $\big((x,0),(x,0)\big)$ and $\big((x,1),(x,1)\big)$ for all
        $x\geq{0}$. This is an equivalence relation, and looking at
        $\mathbb{R}\sqcup\mathbb{R}/R$ with the quotient topology gives us
        the branching line. The construction is shown in
        Fig.~\ref{fig:Construction_of_Branching_Line}.
        \begin{figure}[H]
                \centering
                \captionsetup{type=figure}
                \input{tikz/Branching_Line_Construction.tex}
                \caption{Construction of the Branching Line}
                \label{fig:Construction_of_Branching_Line}
        \end{figure}
        Both the bug-eyed line and the branching line are examples of
        non-Hausdorff, non-homogeneous, locally Euclidean second countable
        topological spaces. Moreover, they are both path-connected. While
        connected Hausdorff spaces that are locally Euclidean are indeed
        homogeneous, the converse is not true. That is, the are connected
        homogeneous locally Euclidean spaces that are not Hausdorff. If one
        adds the Lindel\"{o}f requirement, then it can be proved that the
        space is Hausdorff.
        \begin{fdefinition}{The Complete Feather}{The_Complete_Feather}
                The complete feather is the set:
                \begin{equation*}
                    F=\Big(\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb{N}^{+}}
                        \big\{\,\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^{n+1}\;|\;
                            \forall_{i\in\mathbb{Z}_{n-1}}(x_{i}<x_{i+1})
                            \land(x_{n-1}\leq{x}_{n})\,\big\}\Big)
                        \bigcup\mathbb{R}
                \end{equation*}
        \end{fdefinition}
        The complete feather is a subset of $\bigcup\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with the
        additional requirements that $x_{0}<x_{1}<\dots<x_{m-1}\leq{x}_{m}$.
        No such restraint is imposed on the $\mathbb{R}^{1}$ term. We place
        a topology by considering the following partial ordering.
        \begin{theorem}
                If $(X,\tau)$ is a Lindel\"{o}f topological space that is
                locally second countable, then it is second countable.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
                For if $(X,\tau)$ is locally second countable, for all $x\in{X}$
                there is an open subset $\mathcal{U}_{x}\in\tau$ such that
                $(\mathcal{U}_{x},\tau|_{\mathcal{U}_{x}})$ has a countable
                basis, where $\tau|_{\mathcal{U}_{x}}$ is the subspace topology.
                But then the set:
                \begin{equation}
                    \mathcal{O}=
                    \{\,\mathcal{U}_{x}\in\tau\;|\;x\in{X}\,\}
                \end{equation}
                is an open cover of $X$. But $(X,\tau)$ is Lindel\"{o}f and thus
                there is a countable subcover $\Delta$. But for all
                $\mathcal{U}\in\Delta$ there is a countable basis for
                $\mathcal{U}$, $\mathscr{B}_{\mathcal{U}}$. But then:
                \begin{equation}
                    \mathscr{O}=
                    \bigcup_{\mathcal{U}\in\Delta}
                        \{\,\mathscr{B}_{\mathcal{U}}\;|\;
                            \mathcal{U}\in\Delta\,\}
                \end{equation}
                Is countable basis for $(X,\tau)$. It is countable since it is
                the countable union of countable sets. Morever, let
                $\mathcal{V}\in\tau$. But since $\Delta$ is a cover of $X$, we
                have:
                \begin{equation}
                    \mathcal{V}
                    =\mathcal{V}\cap{X}
                    =\mathcal{V}\cap\Big(
                        \bigcup_{\mathcal{U}\in\Delta}\mathcal{U}
                    \Big)
                    =\bigcup_{\mathcal{U}\in\Delta}\big(
                        \mathcal{U}\cap\mathcal{V}
                    \big)
                \end{equation}
                But for all $\mathcal{U}\in\Delta$ it is true that
                $\mathcal{U}\cap\mathcal{V}\subseteq\mathcal{U}$. But then there
                is a subset
                $\Delta_{\mathcal{U}}\subseteq\mathscr{B}_{\mathcal{U}}$
                \begin{equation}
                    \mathcal{U}\cap\mathcal{V}=
                    \bigcup_{A\in\Delta_{\mathcal{U}}}A
                \end{equation}
                Thus:
                \begin{equation}
                    \mathcal{V}=\bigcup_{\mathcal{U}\in\Delta}\Big(
                        \bigcup_{A\in\Delta_{\mathcal{U}}}A\Big)
                \end{equation}
        \end{proof}
    \section{Topological Manifolds}
        Manifolds are locally Euclidean spaces that have sufficiently nice
        structure to exclude pathalogical examples such as the bug-eyed line
        and the long line. Manifolds are required to have a second-countable
        topology and must also be Hausdorff.
        \begin{fdefinition}{Topological Manifold}{Topological_Manifold}
            A topological manifold of dimension $n\in\mathbb{N}$ is a
            Hausdorff locally Euclidean topological space of dimension $n$
            that is second countable.
        \end{fdefinition}
        \begin{fdefinition}{Atlas}{Atlas}
            An atlas on a topological space $(X,\tau)$ is a set
            $\mathcal{A}$ such that for all $z\in\mathcal{U}$ it is true
            that $z$ is a chart in $(X,\tau)$, and such that for all
            $x\in{X}$ there exists a chart
            $(\mathcal{U},\varphi)\in\mathcal{A}$ such that
            $x\in\mathcal{U}$.
        \end{fdefinition}
        An atlas for a connected space necessarily has a constant and well
        defined dimension, whereas the by definition of a manifold, any
        atlas on a manifold must have the same dimension.
    \section{Smooth Manifolds}
        Smooth manifolds are topological manifolds with a smooth structure
        on them so that one can do calculus. Such objects first require a
        notion of smooth functions, and we define this in terms of the
        familiar notions of smoothness of functions between Euclidean spaces
        $f:\mathbb{R}^{m}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n}$.
        \begin{fdefinition}{Smooth Real-Valued Functions On $\mathbb{R}$}
                           {Smooth_Real_Valued_Functions_on_R}
            A smooth real-valued function on an open subset
            $\mathcal{U}\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is a function
            $f:\mathcal{U}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ such that all mixed partial
            derivatives of all orders exist and are continuous for all
            $\mathbf{x}\in\mathcal{U}$.
        \end{fdefinition}
        $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ can be defined as the set of all functions
        $\mathbf{x}:\mathbb{Z}_{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$. Given an element
        $\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and $k\in\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ we denote
        image of $k$ as $x_{k}=\mathbf{x}(k)$. This is called the $k^{th}$
        coordinate of $\mathbf{x}$. The projection mapping
        $\pi_{k}:\mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ for
        $k\in\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ is the function defined by
        $\pi_{k}(\mathbf{x})=x_{k}$. We can use this notion to define smooth
        functions between arbitrary Euclidean spaces by requiring the
        composition of $f:\mathbb{R}^{m}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with
        $\pi_{k}$ to be smooth for all $k$.
        \begin{fdefinition}{Smooth Euclidean Functions}
                           {Smooth_Euclidean_Functions}
            A smooth function on a subset
            $\mathcal{U}\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{m}$ to $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is a
            function $f:\mathcal{U}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{m}$ such that, for
            all $k\in\mathbb{Z}_{n}$, the function $\pi_{k}\circ{f}$ is a
            smooth real-valued function.
        \end{fdefinition}
        We can use this definition to create a notion of smoothness on a
        manifold by considering charts that overlap \textit{smoothly}.
        \begin{fdefinition}{Smoothly Overlapping Charts}
                               {Smoothly_Overlapping_Charts}
                Smoothly overlapping charts of dimension $n\in\mathbb{N}$ are
                charts $(\mathcal{U}_{1},\varphi_{1})$ and

            If $(X,\tau)$ is a topological space and if $\mathcal{A}$ is a

            there is a unique maximal smooth atlas $\mathcal{C}$ on
            $(X,\tau)$ such that $\mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathcal{C}$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            For let $\mathcal{C}$ be the set of all charts on $(X,\tau)$
            that overlap smoothly with the charts in $\mathcal{A}$. Then
            since $\mathcal{A}$ is an atlas, for all
            $(\mathcal{U},\phi)\in\mathcal{A}$ and for all
            $(\mathcal{V},\xi)\in\mathcal{A}$, we have that
            $(\mathcal{U},\phi)$ and $(\mathcal{V},\xi)$ overlap smoothly,
            and thus $(\mathcal{U},\phi)\in\mathcal{C}$. Therefore
            $\mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathcal{C}$. But $\mathcal{A}$ is an
            atlas and thus for all $x\in{X}$ there is a chart
            $(\mathcal{U},\phi)\in\mathcal{A}$ such that $x\in\mathcal{U}$.
            But $\mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathcal{C}$ and thus
            $(\mathcal{U},\phi)\in\mathcal{C}$. Thus, for all $x\in{X}$ there
            is a chart $(\mathcal{U},\phi)\in\mathcal{C}$ such that
            $x\in\mathcal{U}$. Suppose
            $(\mathcal{U}_{1},\phi_{1}),%
             (\mathcal{U}_{2},\phi_{2})\in\mathcal{C}$.
            If $\mathcal{U}_{1}$ and $\mathcal{U}_{2}$ are disjoint, then
            these two charts overlap smoothly. Suppose it is non-empty and let
            $f$ be the transition function of $(\mathcal{U}_{1},\phi_{1})$ with
            respect to $(\mathcal{U}_{2},\phi_{2})$. Let
            $p\in\phi_{1}(\mathcal{U}_{1}\cap\mathcal{U}_{2})$. But then there
            is a chart $\xi\in\mathcal{A}$ such that $\phi_{2}^{\minus{1}}(p)$
            is contained in the domain of $\xi$. From the associativity of
            composition, we have:
            \begin{equation}
                \phi_{1}\circ\phi_{2}^{\minus{1}}
                =(\phi_{1}\circ\xi^{\minus{1}})\circ
                 (\xi\circ\phi_{2}^{\minus{1}})
            \end{equation}
            But by the definition of $\mathcal{C}$, $\phi_{1}$ and $\phi_{2}$
            overlap smoothly with $\xi$, and thus this is the composition of
            smooth functions, and is therefore smooth. Therefore
            $\phi_{1}\circ\phi_{2}^{\minus{1}}$ is smooth and thus
            $(\mathcal{U}_{1},\phi_{1})$ and $(\mathcal{U}_{2},\phi_{2})$
            overlap smoothly. Thus, $\mathcal{C}$ is a smooth atlas. Moreover,
            it is complete from the construction. Given any other complete
            atlas $\mathcal{C}'$ that contains $\mathcal{A}$ we would have
            $\mathcal{C}\subseteq\mathcal{C}'$ and
            $\mathcal{C}'\subseteq\mathcal{C}$, and therefore
            $\mathcal{C}=\mathcal{C}'$. Thus, this completion is unique.

            A smooth manifold of dimension $n\in\mathbb{N}$, denoted
            $(X,\tau,\mathcal{A})$ is topological manifold $(X,\tau)$ with
            a maximal smooth atlas $\mathcal{A}$ of dimension $n$ on
            $(X,\tau)$.
        \end{fdefinition}
        Any smooth atlas $\mathcal{A}$ on a topological space $(X,\tau)$
        defines a a smooth manifold if we let $\mathcal{C}$ be the maximal
        smooth atlas generated by $\mathcal{A}$.
        \begin{example}
            Let $(\mathbb{R}^{n},\tau_{\mathbb{R}^{n}})$ be the standard
            $n$ dimensional Euclidean space. We can define a trivial smooth
            atlas on this space by let
            $\mathcal{A}=\{(\mathbb{R}^{n},\textrm{id})\}$, where $\textrm{id}$
            is the identity function. This defines a smooth atlas. By
            considering the unique maximal smooth atlas generated by this
            we obtain the standard smooth structure on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$.
        \end{example}
        \begin{theorem}
            If $(X,\tau,\mathcal{A})$ is a smooth manifold of dimension
            $n\in\mathbb{N}$, if $(\mathcal{U},\varphi)$ is a chart in
            $\mathcal{A}$, if $\mathcal{V}\in\tau$, and if
            $\varphi_{\mathcal{V}}$ denotes the restriction mapping:
            $\varphi_{\mathcal{V}}:\mathcal{V}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n}$,
            then $(\mathcal{V},\varphi_{\mathcal{V}})\in\mathcal{A}$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            For since $\phi$ is a homeomorphism from $\mathcal{U}$ to
            $\phi(\mathcal{U})$, and since $\mathcal{V}\in\tau$, we have
            that $\phi_{\mathcal{V}}$ is a homeomorphism between
            $\mathcal{V}$ and $\phi_{\mathcal{V}}(\mathcal{V})$, and
            therefore $(\mathcal{V},\phi_{\mathcal{V}})$ is a chart. But
            this chart meets $(\mathcal{U},\phi)$ smoothly, and $\mathcal{A}$
            is complete. Thus,
            $(\mathcal{V},\phi_{\mathcal{A}})\in\mathcal{A}$.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
            If $n\in\mathbb{N}$, then there is a complete atlas
            $\mathcal{A}$ on $(S^{n},\tau)$, where $\tau$ is the inherited
            topology from $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$.

        \begin{proof}
            For all $k\in\mathbb{Z}_{n+1}$, let $\mathcal{U}_{k}^{+}$ and
            $\mathcal{U}_{k}^{\minus}$ be defined as:

                \end{equation}
            \end{minipage}
            \par\vspace{2.5ex}
            Define $\phi_{\mathcal{U}_{k}^{+}}:\mathcal{U}_{k}^{+}%
                    \rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n}$ by:
            \begin{equation}
                \phi_{\mathcal{U}_{k}^{+}}(\mathbf{x})
                =(x_{1},\,\dots,\,x_{k-1},\,x_{k+1},\,\dots,\,x_{n+1})
            \end{equation}
            That is, the mapping that projects the point onto the plane
            defined by $x_{k}=0$. Define $\phi_{\mathcal{U}_{k}^{\minus}}$
            similarly. Then all such $\phi$ are homeomorphisms from their
            domain to their image. Let $\mathcal{A}$ be defined as follows:
            \begin{equation}
                \mathcal{A}
                =\big\{\,(\mathcal{U}_{k}^{+},\,\phi_{\mathcal{U}_{k}^{+}})
                       \,:\,k\in\mathbb{Z}_{n}\big\}\bigcup
                \big\{\,(\mathcal{U}_{k}^{-},\,\phi_{\mathcal{U}_{k}^{-}})
                       \,:\,k\in\mathbb{Z}_{n}\big\}
            \end{equation}
            Then $\mathcal{A}$ is an atlas of $(S^{n},\tau)$. For if
            $\mathbf{x}\in{S}^{n}$, then $\norm{\mathbf{x}}_{2}=1$. But then
            there is a coordinate $x_{k}$ of $\mathbf{x}$ such that
            $x_{k}\ne{0}$. But then either $x_{k}>0$ or $x_{k}<0$, and thus
            either $\mathbf{x}\in\mathcal{U}_{k}^{+}$ or
            $\mathbf{x}\in\mathcal{U}_{k}^{\minus}$. If
            $(\mathcal{V}_{2},\phi_{2})$ and $(\mathcal{V}_{2},\phi_{2})$
            are charts, then either $\phi_{1}(\mathcal{V}_{1})$
            and $\phi_{2}(\mathcal{V}_{2})$ are disjoint or they are not.
            If they are disjoint, then $\phi_{1}$ and $\phi_{2}$ overlap
            smoothly. If they are not disjoint, let $\mathbf{x}$ be contained
            in the intersection. But then, for all $k\in\mathbb{Z}_{n}$,
            $\pi_{k}\circ(\phi_{1}\circ\phi_{2}^{\minus{1}})$ is smooth,
            and thus $\phi_{1}$ and $\phi_{2}$ overlap smoothly.

        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            For by the previous theorem, $\mathcal{A}_{\mathcal{U}}$ is a
            complete atlas. Moreover, a subspace of a Hausdorff topological
            space is also a Hausdorff topological space, and hence
            $(\mathcal{U},\tau_\mathcal{U})$ is a Hausdorff space. Thus,
            $(\mathcal{U},\tau_\mathcal{U},\mathcal{A}_{\mathcal{U}})$ is
            a smooth manifold.

            $(\mathcal{V},\xi)$ on a topological space $(Y,\tau_{Y})$ is
            the ordered pair $(\mathcal{U}\times\mathcal{V},f)$ where
            $f:\mathcal{U}\times\mathcal{V}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n+m}$
            defined by:

            Where $\phi(p)_{k}$ is the $k^{th}$ coordinate of

            $(\mathcal{U},\phi)\times(\mathcal{V},\xi)$.
        \end{fdefinition}
        Thinking of the elements of $\mathbb{R}^{n+m}$ as tuples of length
        $n+m$, we can write:
        \begin{equation}
            f(p,q)=\big(x_{1}(p),\dots,x_{n}(p),y_{1}(q),\dots,y_{m}(q)\big)

            If $(X,\tau_{X},\mathcal{A}_{X})$ and $(Y,\tau_{Y},\mathcal{A}_{Y})$
            are smooth manifolds, and if $\mathcal{A}$ is the set of all
            product charts on $X\times{Y}$, then $\mathcal{A}$ is a smooth
            atlas on $(X\times{Y},\tau_{X\times{Y}})$, where
            $\tau_{X\times{Y}}$ is the product topology.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            For if $p\in{X}\times{Y}$ then there is an $x\in{X}$ and a
            $y\in{Y}$ such that $p=(x,y)$. But $\mathcal{A}_{X}$ is a smooth
            atlas on $(X,\tau_{X})$, and thus if $x\in{X}$ then there is a
            $(\mathcal{U},\phi)\in\mathcal{A}_{X}$ such that $x\in\mathcal{U}$.
            Similarly, there is a $(\mathcal{V},\xi)\in\mathcal{A}_{Y}$ such
            that $y\in\mathcal{V}$. But then $p\in\mathcal{U}\times\mathcal{V}$,
            and $\mathcal{U}\times\mathcal{V}\in\tau_{X\times{Y}}$. But if
            $\phi:\mathcal{U}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is a homeomorphism
            between $\mathcal{U}$ and $\phi(\mathcal{U})$ and
            $\xi:\mathcal{V}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{m}$ is a homemorphism
            between $\mathcal{V}$ and $\xi(\mathcal{V})$, then
            $f:\mathcal{U}\times\mathcal{V}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n+m}$ is
            a homeomorphism between $\mathcal{U}\times\mathcal{V}$ and
            $f(\mathcal{U}\times\mathcal{V})$, and thus the product chart
            is a chart in $(X\times{Y},\tau_{X\times{Y}})$. Moreover, all of
            the elements of $\mathcal{A}$ are smoothly overlapping. Thus,
            $\mathcal{A}$ is an atlas on $(X\times{Y},\tau_{X\times{Y}})$.
        \end{proof}
        Using the maximal smooth atlas generated by the product atlas
        $\mathcal{A}$ creates the product manifold.

                then $(f\cdot{g}):X\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ defined by:
                \begin{equation}

                    x\in{X}
                \end{equation}
                Is a smooth real-valued function.

            \begin{fdefinition}{Smooth Functions Between Manifolds}
                               {Smooth Functions Between Manifolds}
                A smooth function from a smooth manifold
                $(X,\tau_{X},\mathcal{A}_{X})$ of dimension $m\in\mathbb{N}$
                to a smooth manifold $(Y,\tau_{Y},\mathcal{A}_{Y})$ of
                dimension $n\in\mathbb{N}$ is a function
                $\phi:X\rightarrow{Y}$ such that for every chart
                $(\mathcal{U},\varphi)\in\mathcal{A}_{X}$ and for every
                chart $(\mathcal{V},\psi)\in\mathcal{A}_{Y}$, the function
                $\psi\circ\phi\circ\varphi^{\minus{1}}:\varphi(\mathcal{V})%
                 \rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is a smooth function.
            \end{fdefinition}
            \begin{theorem}
                If $(X,\tau_{X},\mathcal{A}_{X})$ and
                $(Y,\tau_{Y},\mathcal{A}_{Y})$ are manifolds, if
                $A_{X}\subseteq\mathcal{A}_{X}$ is an atlas on $(X,\tau_{X})$,
                if $A_{Y}\subseteq\mathcal{A}_{Y}$ is an atlas on
                $(Y,\tau_{Y})$, and if $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ is a function such
                that, for all $(\mathcal{U},\phi)\in{A}_{X}$ and for all
                $(\mathcal{Y},\xi)\in{A}_{y}$ it is true that
                $\xi\circ{f}\circ\phi^{\minus{1}}:\xi(\mathcal{V})%
                 \rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{m}$ is a smooth Euclidean function,
                then $f$ is smooth.
            \end{theorem}
            \begin{proof}
                Since charts in $\mathcal{A}_{X}$ and $\mathcal{A}_{Y}$
                overlap smoothly with charts in $A_{X}$ and $A_{Y}$, and since
                the atlases $A_{X}$ and $A_{Y}$ cover $X$ and $Y$, respectively,
                we are done.
            \end{proof}
            \begin{theorem}
                If $(X,\tau_{X},\mathcal{A}_{X})$ is a manifold, then
                $\textrm{id}:X\rightarrow{X}$ is a smooth function.
            \end{theorem}
            \begin{theorem}
                If $(X,\tau_{X},\mathcal{A}_{X})$,
                $(Y,\tau_{Y},\mathcal{A}_{Y})$, and
                $(Z,\tau_{Z},\mathcal{A}_{Z})$ are manifolds, if
                $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ and $g:Y\rightarrow{Z}$ are smooth, then
                $g\circ{f}:X\rightarrow{Z}$ is smooth.
            \end{theorem}
            Smoothness is a local property. A function $\phi:M\rightarrow{N}$
            is smooth at $p\in{M}$ if there is a neighborhood
            $\mathcal{U}$ of $p$ such that the restriction of $\phi$ to
            $\mathcal{U}$ is smooth. A smooth function is thus a function
            that is smooth at every point.
            \begin{theorem}
                If $(X,\mathcal{A}_{X},\tau_{X})$ and
                $(Y,\mathcal{A}_{Y},\tau_{Y})$ are manifolds and if
                $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ is smooth, then $f$ is continuous.
            \end{theorem}
            \begin{fdefinition}{Diffeomorphism}{Diffeomorphism}
                A diffeomorphism from a manifold
                $(X,\tau_{X},\mathcal{A}_{X})$ to a manifold
                $(Y,\tau_{Y},\mathcal{A}_{Y})$ is a bijective function
                $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ such that $f$ and $f^{\minus{1}}$ are
                smooth.
            \end{fdefinition}
            \begin{example}
                For any $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$ with $a<b$, the interval
                $(a,b)$ is diffeomorphic to the unit interval $(0,1)$. For
                let $\phi:(0,1)\rightarrow(a,b)$ be defined by:
                \begin{equation}
                    \phi(t)=(a-b)t+b
                \end{equation}
                Then $\phi$ is a smooth bijection and it's inverse is
                smooth. Moreover, the unit interval is diffeomorphic to
                $\mathbb{R}$. For let $\xi:(0,1)\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ be
                defined by:
                \begin{equation}
                    \xi(t)=\frac{2t}{t(1-t)}
                \end{equation}
            \end{example}
            \begin{theorem}
                If $(X,\tau_{X},\mathcal{A}_{X})$ and
                $(Y,\tau_{Y},\mathcal{A}_{Y})$ are manifolds, and if
                $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ is a diffeomorphism, then $f$ is a
                homeomorphism from $(X,\tau_{X})$ to $(Y,\tau_{Y})$.
            \end{theorem}
            \begin{proof}
                For if $f$ is a diffeomorphism, then it is a smooth bijection
                such that it's inverse is smooth. But if $f$ is smooth, then
                it is continuous and therefore it is a continuous bijection.
                But if $f^{\minus{1}}$ is smooth, then it is continuous, and
                thus $f$ is a bicontinuous bijective function, and is therefore
                a homeomorphism.
            \end{proof}
            A smooth homeomorphism need not be a diffeomorphism. The inverse
            function may not be smooth. For let
            $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ be defined by $f(x)=x^{3}$.
            Then $f$ is a homeomorphism and it's forward direction is smooth,
            but $f^{\minus{1}}$ is not smooth at the origin.
            \begin{theorem}
                If $A$ is a set, if $(X,\tau,\mathcal{A})$ is a manifold, and
                if $f:A\rightarrow{X}$ is an bijective function, then there
                exists a topology $\tau_{A}$ and an atlas $\mathcal{A}_{A}$
                on $X$ such that $f$ is a diffeomorphism.
