    \section{Locally Euclidean Spaces}
        We wish to speak about topological spaces that are sufficiently well
        behaved in the sense that it allows one to do calculus. The first
        naive approach is to consider such spaces that can be locally
        approximated by Euclidean space.
        \begin{fdefinition}{Chart}{Chart}
            A chart of dimension $n\in\mathbb{N}$ in a topological space
            $(X,\tau)$, denoted $(\mathcal{U},\varphi)$, is an open set
            $\mathcal{U}\in\tau$ and a function
            $\varphi:\mathcal{U}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n}$ such that
            $\varphi$ is injective, continuous, and an open mapping with
            respect to the standard topology on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$.
        \end{fdefinition}
        Some authors simply denote a chart by the function $\varphi$. Note
        that since the image of $\varphi$ lies in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, if we
        compose with one of the projection mappings $\pi_{k}$ we obtain a
        function $\pi_{k}\circ\phi:\mathcal{U}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$. These
        are called the coordinate functions of the chart
        $(\mathcal{U},\phi)$ and are often denoted $x^{k}=\pi_{k}\circ\phi$.
        Note that we may then write the image of $p\in\mathcal{U}$ as:
        \begin{equation}
            \phi(p)=\big(x^{1}(p),\dots,x^{n}(p)\big)
        \end{equation}
        and such notation is often useful. Avoiding the \textit{dot dot dot}
        notation, we can recall that $\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is a
        function $\mathbf{x}:\mathbb{Z}_{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$. Thus if
        $p\in\mathcal{U}$ and $\mathbf{x}=\phi(p)$, we can write this
        explicitly by:
        \begin{equation}
            \big(\phi(p)\big)(k)=\mathbf{x}(k)=x_{k}=x^{k}(p)
        \end{equation}
        Thus distinguishing the difference between the notation $x^{k}$ and
        $x_{k}$. Here, $x_{k}$ is simply a real number, $x^{k}$ is a function
        $x^{k}:\mathcal{U}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$, and $\mathbf{x}(k)$ is the
        image of $k\in\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ under $\mathbf{x}$. In other words, it is
        the $k^{th}$ component of $\mathbf{x}$.
        \begin{example}
            If $X=\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and $\tau$ is the standard topology, then
            for any open subset $\mathcal{U}\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{n}$ the
            pair $(\mathcal{U},\textrm{id}_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}|_{\mathcal{U}})$
            is a chart, where $\textrm{id}_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}|_{\mathcal{U}}$
            denotes the restriction of the identity map to $\mathcal{U}$.
        \end{example}
        \begin{example}
            If $X=S^{2}$, and if $\tau$ is the subspace topology inherited
            from $\mathbb{R}^{3}$, then we can form a chart around the
            south pole $(0,0,\minus{1})$ as follows. Let
            $\mathcal{U}=S^{2}\setminus\{(0,0,1)\}$. Since $\mathbb{R}^{3}$
            is Hausdorff, and since $S^{2}$ is a subspace of
            $\mathbb{R}^{3}$, it then follows that $S^{2}$ is Hausdorff. But
            if $S^{2}$ is Hausdorff, then the set $\{(0,0,1)\}$ is closed
            since finite sets are closed in a Hausdorff space. But then
            $X\setminus\{(0,0,1)\}$ is the complement of a closed set, and
            thus by definition is open. Hence, $\mathcal{U}$ is an open
            subset of $S^{2}$. We can construct our open mapping
            $\phi:\mathcal{U}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{2}$ by using the
            \textit{stereographic projection}:
            \begin{equation}
                \phi(x,y,z)=\Big(\frac{x}{1-z},\frac{y}{1-z}\Big)
                \quad\quad
                \forall_{(x,y,z)\in{S}^{2}\setminus\{(0,0,1)\}}
            \end{equation}
            This function is continuous and bijective, and has a continuous
            inverse:
            \begin{equation}
                \phi^{\minus{1}}(X,Y)=
                \Big(\frac{2X}{1+X^{2}+Y^{2}},\frac{2Y}{1+X^{2}+Y^{2}},
                    \frac{\minus{1}+X^{2}+Y^{2}}{1+X^{2}+Y^{2}}\Big)
            \end{equation}
            Therefore $\phi$ is a homeomorphism from $\mathcal{U}$ to
            $\mathbb{R}^{2}$, and is thus necessarily a continuous injective
            open mapping. This chart $(\mathcal{U},\phi)$ is actually a
            chart for any point that is not the north pole. If we flip this
            around and do the stereographic projection about the south pole,
            we'll obtain a chart that contains the north pole. Thus the
            sphere can be covered by two charts.
        \end{example}
        \begin{example}
            Another example of a chart on the sphere is the
            \textit{orthographic projection}. The stereographic projection
            is obtain by placing an observer at one of the poles, and
            drawing a straight line from the observer to a point on the
            sphere. This point then gets mapped to $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ by
            finding where this line intersects the $xy$ plane. The
            orthographic is obtained in a similar manner by placing the
            observer \textit{at infinity}. There is now the problem that
            such a straight line intersects the sphere twice: Once on the
            top and once on the bottom. That is, if $(x,y,z)$ lies on this
            line, then so does $(x,y,\minus{z})$. To form our chart we must
            consistently choose either the top or the bottom. Let
            $\mathcal{U}$ be defined as follows:
            \begin{equation}
                \mathcal{U}=\{(x,y,z)\in{S}^{2}\;|\;z>0\}
            \end{equation}
            Define the orthographic projection by:
            \begin{equation}
                \phi(x,y,z)=(x,y)
            \end{equation}
            This is a homeomorphism between $\mathcal{U}$ and the open unit
            disc $B_{1}(0)$. The inverse function is:
            \begin{equation}
                \phi^{\minus{1}}(X,Y)=\big(X,Y,\sqrt{1-X^{2}-Y^{2}}\big)
            \end{equation}
            where we unambiguously take the positive square root. This is
            a chart for any point in the upper hemisphere (the equator is
            not included). To completely cover the sphere using orthographic
            projections requires 6 charts ($\pm{x}$, $\pm{y}$, $\pm{z}$,
            our open set $\mathcal{U}$ corresponding to $+z$).
        \end{example}
        Equivalently, one could say that $\phi$ is a homeomorphism between
        $\mathcal{U}$ and it's image under $\phi$. That is,
        $\phi(\mathcal{U})\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is homeomorphic to
        $\mathcal{U}$ and $\phi:\mathcal{U}\rightarrow\phi(\mathcal{U})$ is
        a homeomorphism.
        \begin{theorem}
            If $(X,\tau)$ is a topological space, if $n\in\mathbb{N}$, if
            $(\mathcal{U},\phi)$ is a chart in $(X,\tau)$, and if
            $\mathcal{V}=\phi(\mathcal{U})$ is the image of $\mathcal{U}$
            under $\phi$, then $\phi:\mathcal{U}\rightarrow\mathcal{V}$ is
            a homeomorphism.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            For since $(\mathcal{U},\phi)$ is a chart, $\phi$ is injective,
            continuous, and an open mapping. But since $\mathcal{V}$ is the
            image of $\mathcal{U}$ under $\phi$, the restriction
            $\phi:\mathcal{U}\rightarrow\mathcal{V}$ is therefore
            surjective. But then $\phi:\mathcal{U}\rightarrow\mathcal{V}$ is
            both injective and surjective, and is therefore bijective. But
            since $\phi$ is an open mapping, $\phi^{\minus{1}}$ is
            continuous. But then $\phi$ is a continuous bijection with a
            continuous inverse and is thus a homeomorphism.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{fdefinition}{Locally Euclidean Space}
                           {Locally Euclidean Space}
            A locally Euclidean space is a topological space $(X,\tau)$
            such that for all $x\in{X}$ there exists an $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and
            an $n$ dimensional chart $(\mathcal{U},\phi)$ of $(X,\tau)$ such
            that $x\in\mathcal{U}$.
        \end{fdefinition}
        This is the most general setting for one to define a manifold. The
        dimension of a locally Euclidean space need not be constant, for we
        can consider the disjoint union of a sphere with a line. Thus there
        will be 2 dimensional points and 1 dimensional points. Dimension is,
        however, a locally constant property. In particular, for any fixed
        point $x\in{X}$ there is only one $n\in\mathbb{N}$ such that
        $x$ is locally like $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. If in addition the space
        $(X,\tau)$ is connected, then there is only one unambiguous number
        $n\in\mathbb{N}$ such that every point $x\in{X}$ is locally like
        $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. This allows us to define dimension.
        \begin{theorem}
            If $X$ and $Y$ are sets, if $\mathcal{U}\subseteq{X}$, if
            $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ is a function, if
            $f|_{\mathcal{U}}:\mathcal{U}\rightarrow{f}(\mathcal{U})$ is the
            restriction of $f$ to $\mathcal{U}$, and if
            $\mathcal{V}\subseteq{f}(\mathcal{U})$, then:
            \begin{equation}
                f|_{\mathcal{U}}^{\minus{1}}(\mathcal{V})
                =\mathcal{U}\cap{f}^{\minus{1}}(\mathcal{V})
            \end{equation}
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            For if $x\in{f}|_{\mathcal{U}}^{\minus{1}}(\mathcal{V})$, then
            there is an $x\in\mathcal{U}$ such that
            $f|_{\mathcal{U}}(x)\in\mathcal{V}$. But for all
            $x\in\mathcal{U}$ it is true that $f|_{\mathcal{U}}(x)=f(x)$,
            and thus $f(x)\in\mathcal{V}$. But if $f(x)\in\mathcal{V}$, then
            $x\in{f}^{\minus{1}}(\mathcal{V})$. Thus $x\in\mathcal{U}$ and
            $x\in{f}^{\minus{1}}(\mathcal{V})$, and therefore
            $x\in\mathcal{U}\cap{f}^{\minus{1}}(\mathcal{V})$. So we obtain:
            \begin{equation}
                f|_{\mathcal{U}}^{\minus{1}}(\mathcal{V})
                \subseteq\mathcal{U}\cap{f}^{\minus{1}}(\mathcal{V})
            \end{equation}
            In the other direction, if
            $x\in\mathcal{U}\cap{f}^{\minus{1}}(\mathcal{V})$, then
            $x\in\mathcal{U}$ and $f(x)\in\mathcal{V}$. But if
            $x\in\mathcal{U}$, then $f(x)=f|_{\mathcal{U}}(x)$ and therefore
            $f|_{\mathcal{U}}(x)\in\mathcal{V}$. But then
            $x\in{f}|_{\mathcal{U}}^{\minus{1}}(\mathcal{V})$. That is:
            \begin{equation}
                \mathcal{U}\cap{f}^{\minus{1}}(\mathcal{V})
                \subseteq{f}|_{\mathcal{U}}^{\minus{1}}(\mathcal{V})
            \end{equation}
            From the definition of equality, we are done.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
            If $(X,\tau_{X})$ and $(Y,\tau_{Y})$ are topological spaces,
            if $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ is a homeomorphism, and if
            $\mathcal{U}\subseteq{X}$, then the restriction
            $f|_{\mathcal{U}}:\mathcal{U}\rightarrow{f}(\mathcal{U})$ is
            a homeomorphism between $(\mathcal{U},\tau_{X}|_{\mathcal{U}})$
            and $(f(\mathcal{U}),\tau_{Y}|_{f(\mathcal{U})})$, where
            $\tau_{X}|_{\mathcal{U}}$ and $\tau_{Y}|_{f(\mathcal{U})}$ are
            the subspace topologies.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            Since $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ is a homeomorphism it is therefore
            bijective. But then
            $f|_{\mathcal{U}}:\mathcal{U}\rightarrow{f}(\mathcal{U})$ is
            bijective. For if not, then it is either not injective or not
            surjective. But if it is not injective then there exists points
            $x_{1},x_{2}\in\mathcal{U}$ such that $x_{1}\ne{x}_{2}$ and
            $f|_{\mathcal{U}}(x_{1})=f|_{\mathcal{U}}(x_{2})$. But since
            $f|_{\mathcal{U}}$ is the restriction of $f$ to $\mathcal{U}$,
            for all $x\in\mathcal{U}$ it is true that
            $f(x)=f|_{\mathcal{U}}(x)$. But $x_{1},x_{2}\in\mathcal{U}$ and
            thus $f(x_{1})=f|_{\mathcal{U}}(x_{1})$ and similary for
            $x_{2}$. Then by the transitivity of equality,
            $f(x_{1})=f(x_{2})$, a contradiction since $f$ is injective.
            Therefore $f|_{\mathcal{U}}$ is injective. It is surjective by
            the definition of the image of $\mathcal{U}$ under $f$. Thus,
            $f|_{\mathcal{U}}:\mathcal{U}\rightarrow{f}(\mathcal{U})$ is
            bijective. If $\mathcal{V}\subseteq{f}(\mathcal{U})$ is open in
            the subspace topology then there is an open set
            $\mathcal{O}\in\tau_{Y}$ such that
            $\mathcal{V}=\mathcal{O}\cap{f}(\mathcal{U})$. But then:
            \begin{subequations}
                \begin{align}
                    f|_{\mathcal{U}}^{\minus{1}}(\mathcal{V})
                    &=\mathcal{U}\cap{f}^{\minus{1}}(\mathcal{V})\\
                    &=\mathcal{U}\cap
                        f^{\minus{1}}\big(
                            f(\mathcal{U})\cap\mathcal{O}
                        \big)\\
                    &=\mathcal{U}\cap\Big(
                        f^{\minus{1}}\big(f(\mathcal{U})\big)\cap
                        f^{\minus{1}}(\mathcal{O})
                    \Big)\\
                    &=\mathcal{U}\cap\big(
                        \mathcal{U}\cap{f}^{\minus{1}}(\mathcal{O})\big)\\
                    &=\big(\mathcal{U}\cap\mathcal{U})\cap
                        f^{\minus{1}}(\mathcal{O})\\
                    &=\mathcal{U}\cap{f}^{\minus{1}}(\mathcal{O})
                \end{align}
            \end{subequations}
            But $f$ is continuous and therefore $f^{\minus{1}}(\mathcal{O})$
            is an open subset of $X$. But then
            $\mathcal{U}\cap{f}^{\minus{1}}(\mathcal{O})$ is open in the
            subspace topology $\tau_{X}|_{\mathcal{U}}$, and therefore
            $f|_{\mathcal{U}}$ is continuous. In a similar manner,
            $f|_{\mathcal{U}}^{\minus{1}}$ is continuous and therefore
            $f|_{\mathcal{U}}$ is a homeomorphism.
        \end{proof}
        While we were very liberal in our definition of a locally Euclidean
        space, allowing the set $\mathcal{V}\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{n}$ to be
        any open set, we need not be. A topological space is locally
        Euclidean if and only if every point has an open neighborhood that
        is homeomorphic to all of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$.
        \begin{theorem}
            If $(X,\tau)$ is a topological space, $x\in{X}$, if
            $n\in\mathbb{N}$, and if $(\mathcal{U},\phi)$ is an $n$
            dimensional chart in $(X,\tau)$ such that $x\in\mathcal{U}$,
            then there is an open subset $\mathcal{V}\in\tau$ such that
            $x\in\mathcal{V}$ and $\mathcal{V}$ is homeomorphic to
            $\mathbb{R}^{n}$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
                For since $\phi:\mathcal{U}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is an open
                mapping, $\phi(\mathcal{U})$ is an open subset of
                $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. But if $x\in\mathcal{U}$, then
                $\phi(x)\in\phi(\mathcal{U})$. But if $\mathcal{U}$ is open and
                if $\phi(x)\in\phi(\mathcal{U})$, then there is an $r>0$ such
                that the open ball of radius $r$ about $\phi(x)$ is contained in
                $\phi(\mathcal{U})$. That is,
                $B_{r}(\phi(x),\mathbb{R}^{n})\subseteq\phi(\mathcal{U})$. But
                since $B_{r}(\phi(x),\mathbb{R}^{n})\subseteq\phi(\mathcal{U})$,
                we have:
                \begin{equation}
                    \phi^{\minus{1}}\big(B_{r}(\phi(x),\mathbb{R}^{n})\big)
                    \subseteq\mathcal{U}
                \end{equation}
                But then since $B_{r}(\phi(x),\mathbb{R}^{n})$ is contained in
                the image of $\mathcal{U}$ under $\phi$, we have:
                \begin{equation}
                    \phi\Big(
                        \phi^{\minus{1}}\big(B_{r}(\phi(x_,\mathbb{R}^{n})\big)
                    \Big)
                    =B_{r}(\phi(x),\mathbb{R}^{n})
                \end{equation}
                But then the restriction of $\phi$ to
                $\phi^{\minus{1}}\big(B_{r}(\phi(x),\mathbb{R}^{n})\big)$ is a
                homeomorphism from
                $\phi^{\minus{1}}\big(B_{r}(\phi(x),\mathbb{R}^{n})\big)$ to
                $B_{r}(\phi(x),\mathbb{R}^{n})$. But
                $B_{r}(\phi(x),\mathbb{R}^{n})$ is homeomorphic to
                $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, and since homeomorphic is an equivalence
                relation, we have that
                $\phi^{\minus{1}}\big(B_{r}(\phi(x),\mathbb{R}^{n})\big)$ is
                homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. But then
                $\phi^{\minus{1}}\big(B_{r}(\phi(x),\mathbb{R}^{n})\big)$ is an
                open subset of $X$ that contains $x$ and is homeomorphic to
                $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, completing the proof.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
                If $(X,\tau)$ is a topological space, if $Y$ is a set with at
                least two points, and if for all locally constant functions
                $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ it is true that $f$ is constant, then
                $(X,\tau)$ is connected.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
                For suppose not. Then there are non-empty disjoint open subsets
                $\mathcal{U},\mathcal{V}\in\tau$ that partition $X$. That is,
                $\mathcal{U}\cap\mathcal{V}=\emptyset$ and
                $\mathcal{U}\cup\mathcal{V}=X$. Since $Y$ has at least two
                points, there are distinct $y_{1},y_{2}\in{Y}$. Let
                $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ be defined as follows:
                \begin{equation}
                    f(x)=
                    \begin{cases}
                        y_{1},&x\in\mathcal{U}\\
                        y_{2},&x\in\mathcal{V}
                    \end{cases}
                \end{equation}
                Then $f$ is locally constant. That is, since $\mathcal{U}$ and
                $\mathcal{V}$ partition $X$, for all $z\in{X}$ it is true that
                either $z\in\mathcal{U}$ or $z\in\mathcal{V}$, but not both.
                Thus suppose there is a $z\in{X}$ such that for all
                $\mathcal{O}\in\tau$ such that $z\in\mathcal{O}$ it is not true
                that $f$ is constant on $\mathcal{O}$. But either
                $z\in\mathcal{U}$ or $z\in\mathcal{V}$. If $z\in\mathcal{U}$,
                then for all $x\in\mathcal{U}$, $f(x)=y_{1}$ and thus $f$ is
                locally constant on $\mathcal{U}$. Similarly if
                $z\in\mathcal{V}$, and thus $f$ is locally constant. It is not
                constant since $\mathcal{U}$ and $\mathcal{V}$ are non-empty,
                and thus $f(X)=\{y_{1},y_{2}\}$, which is not a singleton. A
                contradiction since by hypothesis for all locally constant
                functions $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ it is true that $f$ is constant.
                Therefore, $(X,\tau)$ is connected.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
                If $(X,\tau)$ is a connected topological space, if $Y$ is a set,
                and if $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ is locally constant, then $f$ is
                constant.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
                For suppose not. Then there is a function $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$
                that is locally constant but not constant. But if $f$ is not
                constant, then there are distinct $y_{1},y_{2}\in{Y}$ such that
                $f^{\minus{1}}\{y_{1}\}\ne\emptyset$ and similarly for $y_{2}$.
                Define $\mathcal{U}$ as follows:
                \begin{equation}
                    \mathcal{U}=f^{\minus{1}}\big(\{y_{1}\}\big)
                \end{equation}
                Since $f$ is locally constant, for all $x\in\mathcal{U}$ there
                exists an open subset $\mathcal{V}_{x}\in\tau$ such that
                $x\in\mathcal{V}_{x}$ and $f$ is constant on $\mathcal{V}_{x}$.
                But since $x\in\mathcal{U}$, for all $z\in\mathcal{V}_{x}$ it
                must be true that $f(z)=y_{1}$. But then:
                \begin{equation}
                    \mathcal{U}=
                    \bigcup_{x\in\mathcal{U}}\mathcal{V}_{x}
                \end{equation}
                Since $\mathcal{U}$ is the union of open sets, it must be open
                itself. In a similarly manner, $X\setminus\mathcal{U}$ is open.
                But $X\setminus\mathcal{U}$ is non-empty since
                $f^{\minus{1}}(\{y_{2}\})\subseteq{X}\setminus\mathcal{U}$
                and $f^{\minus{1}}(\{y_{2}\})$ is non-empty. But then
                $\mathcal{U}$ and $X\setminus\mathcal{U}$ are non-empty disjoint
                open sets that partition $X$, and therefore $(X,\tau)$ is
                disconnected, a contradiction. Therefore, $f$ is constant.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
                If $(X,\tau)$ is a topological space, if $x\in{X}$, if
                $m,n\in\mathbb{N}$, if $(\mathcal{U},\varphi)$ and
                $(\mathcal{V},\psi)$ are $m$ and $n$ dimensional charts,
                respectively, and if $x\in\mathcal{U}$ and $x\in\mathcal{V}$,
                then $n=m$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
                For suppose not. Since $\mathcal{U}$ and $\mathcal{V}$ are open,
                $\mathcal{U}\cap\mathcal{V}$ is open. But $x\in\mathcal{U}$ and
                $x\in\mathcal{V}$, and thus $\mathcal{U}\cap\mathcal{V}$ is
                non-empty. But since
                $\varphi:\mathcal{U}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{m}$ and
                $\psi:\mathcal{V}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n}$ are open mappings,
                $\psi\circ\varphi^{\minus{1}}:%
                 \varphi(\mathcal{U}\cap\mathcal{V})\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n}$
                is an open mapping. But since $\mathcal{U}\cap\mathcal{V}$ is
                open, and since $\varphi$ is an open mapping,
                $\varphi(\mathcal{U}\cap\mathcal{V})$ is an open subset of
                $\mathbb{R}^{m}$. But then $\varphi(\mathcal{U}\cap\mathcal{V})$
                is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^{m}$ that is homeomorphic to
                $\psi(\mathcal{U}\cap\mathcal{V})$, which is an open subset
                of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. But then by invariance of domain, $n=m$.
        \end{proof}
        With this we can define a function
        $\textrm{dim}:X\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$ from any locally Euclidean
        topological space $(X,\tau)$ called the \textit{dimension} function.
        Our current goal is to show that this function is locally constant.
        \begin{theorem}
                If $(X,\tau)$ is a locally Euclidean topological space, if
                $\textrm{dim}:X\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$ is the function such that
                for all $x\in{X}$, $\textrm{dim}(x)$ is the unique
                $n\in\mathbb{N}$ such that there exists a chart
                $(\mathcal{U},\varphi)$ of dimension $n$ such that
                $x\in\mathcal{U}$, then $\textrm{dim}$ is locally constant.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
                For suppose not. Then there is a point $x\in{X}$ such that for
                all $\mathcal{U}\in\tau$ such that $x\in\mathcal{U}$, it is not
                true that $f$ is constant on $\mathcal{U}$. But since $(X,\tau)$
                is locally Euclidean, there is an $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and a chart
                $(\mathcal{U},\phi)$ of dimension $n$ such that
                $x\in\mathcal{U}$. But for all $z\in\mathcal{U}$,
                $(\mathcal{U},\phi)$ is a chart of dimension $n$ that contains
                $z$. But the dimension is pointwise invariant, and thus the
                dimension is constant on $\mathcal{U}$, a contradiction. Thus,
                dimension is a locally constant function.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
                If $(X,\tau)$ is a connected locally Euclidean topological
                space, then the dimension is constant.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
                For dimension is locally constant, and locally constant
                functions on a connected topological space are constant.
        \end{proof}
    \section{Homogeneous Spaces}
        \begin{fdefinition}{Homogeneous Topological Space}
                               {Homogeneous_Topological_Space}
                A homogeneous topological space is a topological space
                $(X,\tau)$ such that for all $x,y\in{X}$ there exists a
                homeomorphism $f:X\rightarrow{X}$ such that $f(x)=y$.
        \end{fdefinition}
        Homogeneous spaces are ones where any point $x$ looks locally like
        any other point.
        \begin{example}
                For any $n\in\mathbb{N}$, the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
                is homogeneous. Given $\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\in\mathbb{R}^{n}$,
                define $f:\mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n}$ by:
                \begin{equation}
                    f(\mathbf{z})=\mathbf{y}+(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{z})
                \end{equation}
                Then $f(\mathbf{x})=\mathbf{y}$, as desired. This is bijective
                and bicontinuous, and therefore a homeomorphism. Indeed, by
                invariance of domain it suffices to show that $f$ is bijective
                and continuous. The fact that $f^{\minus{1}}$ is continuous then
                comes for free.
        \end{example}
        \begin{example}
                If $X=S^{n}$, $n>1$, then $S^{n}$ is homogeneous. Given two
                points $\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\in{S}^{n}$, let $R$ be the
                rotation mapping that takes $\mathbf{x}$ to $\mathbf{y}$. This
                is bijective and bicontinuous, and hence a homeomorphism. For
                the case of $n=0$, $S^{0}$ is merely two points and the topology
                is the power set. Letting $f$ be the function that swaps these
                two points shows that $S^{0}$ is also homogeneous.
        \end{example}
        Not every space is homogeneous. We'll need a brief discussion on
        ordered spaces to demonstrate this.
        \begin{definition}
                The order topology from a totally ordered set $(X,\leq)$ is
                the topology $\tau$ generated by sets of the form:
                \begin{equation}
                    (a,b)=\{\,x\in{X}\;|\;a<x\textrm{ and }x<b\,\}
                \end{equation}
                together with open rays:

        \begin{example}
                The standard topology on $\mathbb{R}$ is an order topology
                induced by the standard order. The long line is another such
                topology induced by the lexicographic ordering on
                $[0,1)\times\omega_{1}$, where $\omega_{1}$ is the first
                uncountable ordinal.

                A complete totally ordered set is a totally ordered set
                $(X,\leq)$ with the least upper bound property.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{theorem}
                If $(X,\leq)$ is a totally ordered set, if $\tau$ is the order
                topology, and if $(X,\tau)$ is connected, then $(X,\leq)$ is
                a complete totally ordered set.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
                For suppose not. Then there exists a set
                $\mathcal{U}\subseteq{X}$ that is bounded above that contains
                no least upper bound. Let $\mathcal{V}_{+}$ be defined as
                follows:
                \begin{equation}
                    \mathcal{V}_{+}=\{\,x\in{X}\;|\;
                        \forall_{y\in\mathcal{U}}(y<x)\,\}
                \end{equation}
                Since $\mathcal{U}$ is bounded above, $\mathcal{V}_{+}$ is
                non-empty. Moreover, it is open since:
                \begin{equation}
                    \mathcal{V}_{+}=
                    \bigcup_{x\in\mathcal{V}_{+}}(x,\infty)
                \end{equation}
                For if $x_{0}\in\bigcup(x,\infty)$ then there is an
                $x\in\mathcal{V}_{+}$ such that $x_{0}\in(x,\infty)$. But
                for all $y\in\mathcal{U}$ it is true that $y<x$, and thus by
                transitivity $y<x_{0}$. Thus, by definition,
                $x_{0}\in\mathcal{V}_{+}$. Now if $x_{0}\in\mathcal{V}_{+}$,
                suppose it is not in $\bigcup(x,\infty)$. Then for all
                $x\in\mathcal{V}_{+}$ it is true that $x_{0}<x$, or $x=x_{0}$,
                and thus $x_{0}$ is a greatest lower bound of $\mathcal{V}_{+}$.
                But by construction, $x_{0}$ is then a least upper bound of
                $\mathcal{U}$, but $\mathcal{U}$ has no such thing. Thus
                $x_{0}\in\bigcup(\minus\infty,x)$, and hence we have equality.
                Thus $\mathcal{V}_{+}$ is open. By a similar argument,
                ${X}\setminus\mathcal{V}_{+}$ is open, and hence $X$ is
                disconnected, a contradiction. Thus, $(X,\leq)$ is complete.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
                If $(X,\leq)$ is a totally ordered set, if $\tau$ is the order
                topology, if $\mathcal{U}$ is a connected subset of $X$, and if
                $a,b\in\mathcal{U}$ are such that $a<b$, then
                $(a,b)\subseteq\mathcal{U}$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
                Suppose not. Then there is a $c\in(a,b)$ such that
                $c\notin\mathcal{U}$. But then $(c,\infty)\cap\mathcal{U}$ and
                $(\minus\infty,c)\cap\mathcal{U}$ are disjoint non-empty subsets
                that are open in $\mathcal{U}$, and hence $\mathcal{U}$ is
                disconnected, a contradiction.

                If $(X,<_{X})$ and $(Y,<_{Y})$ are totally ordered sets, if
                $\tau_{X}$ and $\tau_{Y}$ are the order topologies on $X$ and
                $Y$, respectively, if $(X,\tau_{X})$ is a connected topological
                topological space, if $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ is a continuous
                function, and if $a,b\in{X}$ are such that $a<_{X}b$ and
                $f(a)<_{Y}f(b)$, then for all $c\in(f(a),f(b))$ there is an
                $x_{0}\in(a,b)$ such that $f(x_{0})=c$.
        \end{ltheorem}
        \begin{proof}
                For the continuous image of a connected set is connected, and
                thus $f\big([a,b]\big)$ is a connected subset of $Y$. But
                $f(a)\in{f}\big([a,b]\big)$ and $f(b)\in{f}\big([a,b]\big)$ and
                since $f\big([a,b]\big)$ is connected we have that
                $\big(f(a),f(b)\big)\subseteq{f}\big([a,b]\big)$. But then for
                all $c\in\big(f(a),f(b)\big)$ it is true that
                $c\in{f}\big((a,b)\big)$, and thus there is an $x_{0}\in(a,b)$
                such that $f(x_{0})=c$.

        \begin{theorem}
                If $(X,\leq)$ is a totally ordered set, if $\tau$ is the order
                topology, if $(X,\tau)$ is connected, and if $f:X\rightarrow{X}$
                is a homeomorphism, then either $f$ is order preserving or
                order reversing.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
                For suppose not. Then there are $a,b,c\in{X}$ such that
                $a<b$ and $b<c$, yet either $f(b)<f(a)$ and $f(b)<f(c)$, or
                $f(a)<f(b)$ and $f(c)<f(b)$. Suppose $f(a)<f(b)$ and
                $f(c)<f(b)$. Since $a<b$ and $b<c$, by transitivity $a<c$, and
                thus $a\ne{c}$. Furthermore, since $f$ is a homeomorphism it is
                bijective, and therefore injective, and thus $f(a)\ne{f}(c)$.
                But $\leq$ is a total ordering and thus by trichotomy either
                $f(a)<f(c)$ or $f(c)<f(a)$. Suppose $f(a)<f(c)$. But since
                $f(a)<f(c)$ and $f(c)<f(b)$, and thus
                $f(c)\in\big(f(a),f(b)\big)$. But then by the intermediate value
                theorem there is an $x_{0}\in(a,b)$ such that $f(x_{0})=f(c)$.
                But if $x_{0}\in(a,b)$, then $x_{0}<b$. But $b<c$, and therefore
                $x_{0}<c$ and hence $x_{0}\ne{c}$. But then $f(x_{0})=f(c)$ and
                $x_{0}\ne{c}$, contradicting the fact that $f$ is a bijection,
                a contradiction. Similarly, it is not true that $f(b)<f(a)$ and
                $f(b)<f(c)$. Thus, either $f$ is order preserving or order
                reversing.
        \end{proof}
        We can now prove that there are non-homogeneous spaces.
        \begin{example}
                Let $X=(0,1]$, with the standard subspace topology inherited
                from $\mathbb{R}$. This is the same as the order topology from
                the standard ordering. Suppose $(0,1]$ is homogeneous and let
                $x=1$, $y=1/2$. Then there is a homeomorphism
                $f:X\rightarrow{X}$ such that $f(1)=1/2$. But any homeomorphism
                must be order preserving or order reserving, and since
                $1\geq{x}$ for all $x\in(0,1]$, either $f(1)\geq{x}$ for all
                $x$, or $f(1)\leq{x}$ for all $x$. But it $f(1)\leq{x}$ for all
                $x$ then $f(1)$ is a greatest lower bound, but $(0,1]$ has no
                such bound. Hence, $f(1)\geq{x}$ for all $x\in{X}$. But then
                $f(1)=1$, a contradiction since $f(1)=1/2$. Hence, $(0,1]$ is
                not homogeneous.
        \end{example}
        The next theorem to prove is that any connected Hausdorff locally
        Euclidean topological space is homogeneous.
        \begin{theorem}
                If $(X,\tau)$ is a connected Hausdorff locally Euclidean
                topological space, then it is homogeneous.
        \end{theorem}
        If the Hausdorff property is lost we may lose the homogeneity of the
        space as well. The fact that locally Euclidean spaces can be
        non-Hausdorff is one justification for including the Hausdorff
        property in the definition of a topological manifold, which is a
        locally Euclidean Hausdorff topological space that is second
        countable. First we'll demonstrate the existence of non-Hausdorff
        locally Euclidean topological spaces.
        \begin{example}
                Let $X$ be the disjoint union of $\mathbb{R}$ with itself:
                \begin{equation}
                    X=\mathbb{R}\sqcup\mathbb{R}
                \end{equation}
                That is, $X=(\mathbb{R}\times\{0\})\cup(\mathbb{R}\times\{1\})$.
                Furthermore, consider the relation $R'\subseteq{X}\times{X}$
                defined by:
                \begin{equation}
                    R'=\Big\{\,\Big((x,a),(x,b)\Big)\;\Big|\;
                        x\in\mathbb{R}\setminus\{0\}
                        \textrm{ and }a,b\in\mathbb{Z}_{2}\,\Big\}
                \end{equation}
                That is, $(x,a)R'(y,b)$ if and only if $a,b\in\{0,1\}$, and
                $x=y$ are non-zero. From this we can obtain an equivalence
                relation $R$ as follows:
                \begin{equation}
                    R=R'\cup\big\{\big((0,0),(0,0)\big\}\cup
                        \big\{\big((0,1),(0,1)\big\}
                \end{equation}
                That is, $R$ is the reflexive closure of $R'$. This is an
                equivalence relation. Let $Y$ be the topological space
                $(X/R,\tau_{R})$, where $\tau_{R}$ is the quotient topology.
                This space is then locally Euclidean. For if $x\ne{0}$, let
                $r=|x|/2$ Let $\mathcal{U}$ be defined by:
                \begin{equation}
                    \mathcal{U}=\big\{[(y,0)]\in{X}\;|\;|y-x|<r\big\}
                \end{equation}
                Then $\mathcal{U}$ is open since for all points
                $[z]\in\mathcal{U}$, either $z=(y,0)$ or $z=(y,1)$ where
                $|x-y|<r$. By the triangle inequality we can then conclude that
                $y\ne{0}$. But then:
                \begin{equation}
                    \bigcup\mathcal{U}=\Big(B_{r}^{\mathbb{R}}(x)\times\{0\}\Big)
                        \bigcup\Big(B_{r}^{\mathbb{R}}(x)\times\{1\}\Big)
                \end{equation}
                And this is an open subset of $X$ with the disjoint union
                topology, and therefore $\mathcal{U}$ is open in the quotient
                topology. We can define a homemorphism between $\mathcal{U}$ and
                the open interval $(x-r,x+r)$ by defining:
                \begin{equation}
                    \phi\big([(y,0)]\big)=y
                \end{equation}
                Similarly, for the points $(0,0)$ and $(0,1)$ we can define
                $\mathcal{U}_{0}=X\setminus\{[(0,1)]\}$ and
                $\mathcal{U}_{1}=X\setminus\{[0,0]\}$, both of which are
                homeomorphic to all of $\mathbb{R}$. Thus this space, which is
                called the \textit{bug-eyed line}\index{Bug-Eyed Line}, or the
                \textit{line with two origins}\index{Line with Two Origins}, is
                locally Euclidean but is not Hausdorff since every open set
                containing $(0,0)$ and every open set containing $(0,1)$ have
                non-empty intersection.
        \end{example}
        The bug-eyed line\index{Bug-Eyed Line} is shown in
        Fig.~\ref{fig:Bug_Eyed_Line}. The dashed line is used to denote that
        this final sketch is approximately what the space \textit{looks}
        like. We can use this figure to show that any open set containing
        the upper origin must also contain the lower one
        (see Fig.~\ref{fig:Open_Neighborhoods_of_Origins_in_Bug_Eyed_Line}).
        \begin{example}
                The bug-eyed line is not homogeneous. For the points $(0,0)$ and
                $[(1,0)]$ can be separated by open sets, as can the points
                $(0,1)$ and $[(1,0)]$. However $(0,0)$ can not be be separated
                from $(0,1)$, and since homeomorphisms preserve the Hausdorff
                property, there can be no such function $f:X\rightarrow{X}$ such
                that $f\big((0,0)\big)=[(1,0)]$. Hence, the bug-eyed line is
                not homogeneous.
        \end{example}
        \begin{figure}[H]
                \centering
                \captionsetup{type=figure}
                \input{tikz/Bug_Eyed_Line_Construction.tex}
                \caption{Construction of the Bug-Eyed Line}

                \label{fig:Open_Neighborhoods_of_Origins_in_Bug_Eyed_Line}
        \end{figure}
        Another common example of a non-Hausdorff locally Euclidean space is
        the branching line. This is defined in a similar manner as the
        bug-eyed line, but with a slightly different equivalence relation.
        We define $R$ by:
        \begin{equation}
                R=\big\{\,\big((x,a),(x,b)\big)\;|\;
                    x<0\textrm{ and }a,b\in\mathbb{Z}_{2}\big\}
        \end{equation}
        We then look at the reflexive closure of $R$, adding
        $\big((x,0),(x,0)\big)$ and $\big((x,1),(x,1)\big)$ for all
        $x\geq{0}$. This is an equivalence relation, and looking at
        $\mathbb{R}\sqcup\mathbb{R}/R$ with the quotient topology gives us
        the branching line. The construction is shown in
        Fig.~\ref{fig:Construction_of_Branching_Line}.
        \begin{figure}[H]
                \centering
                \captionsetup{type=figure}
                \input{tikz/Branching_Line_Construction.tex}
                \caption{Construction of the Branching Line}
                \label{fig:Construction_of_Branching_Line}
        \end{figure}
        Both the bug-eyed line and the branching line are examples of
        non-Hausdorff, non-homogeneous, locally Euclidean second countable
        topological spaces. Moreover, they are both path-connected. While
        connected Hausdorff spaces that are locally Euclidean are indeed
        homogeneous, the converse is not true. That is, the are connected
        homogeneous locally Euclidean spaces that are not Hausdorff. If one
        adds the Lindel\"{o}f requirement, then it can be proved that the
        space is Hausdorff.
        \begin{fdefinition}{The Complete Feather}{The_Complete_Feather}
                The complete feather is the set:
                \begin{equation*}
                    F=\Big(\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb{N}^{+}}
                        \big\{\,\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^{n+1}\;|\;
                            \forall_{i\in\mathbb{Z}_{n-1}}(x_{i}<x_{i+1})
                            \land(x_{n-1}\leq{x}_{n})\,\big\}\Big)
                        \bigcup\mathbb{R}
                \end{equation*}
        \end{fdefinition}
        The complete feather is a subset of $\bigcup\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with the
        additional requirements that $x_{0}<x_{1}<\dots<x_{m-1}\leq{x}_{m}$.
        No such restraint is imposed on the $\mathbb{R}^{1}$ term. We place
        a topology by considering the following partial ordering.
        \begin{theorem}
                If $(X,\tau)$ is a Lindel\"{o}f topological space that is
                locally second countable, then it is second countable.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
                For if $(X,\tau)$ is locally second countable, for all $x\in{X}$
                there is an open subset $\mathcal{U}_{x}\in\tau$ such that
                $(\mathcal{U}_{x},\tau|_{\mathcal{U}_{x}})$ has a countable
                basis, where $\tau|_{\mathcal{U}_{x}}$ is the subspace topology.
                But then the set:
                \begin{equation}
                    \mathcal{O}=
                    \{\,\mathcal{U}_{x}\in\tau\;|\;x\in{X}\,\}
                \end{equation}
                is an open cover of $X$. But $(X,\tau)$ is Lindel\"{o}f and thus
                there is a countable subcover $\Delta$. But for all
                $\mathcal{U}\in\Delta$ there is a countable basis for
                $\mathcal{U}$, $\mathscr{B}_{\mathcal{U}}$. But then:
                \begin{equation}
                    \mathscr{O}=
                    \bigcup_{\mathcal{U}\in\Delta}
                        \{\,\mathscr{B}_{\mathcal{U}}\;|\;
                            \mathcal{U}\in\Delta\,\}
                \end{equation}
                Is countable basis for $(X,\tau)$. It is countable since it is
                the countable union of countable sets. Morever, let
                $\mathcal{V}\in\tau$. But since $\Delta$ is a cover of $X$, we
                have:
                \begin{equation}
                    \mathcal{V}
                    =\mathcal{V}\cap{X}
                    =\mathcal{V}\cap\Big(
                        \bigcup_{\mathcal{U}\in\Delta}\mathcal{U}
                    \Big)
                    =\bigcup_{\mathcal{U}\in\Delta}\big(
                        \mathcal{U}\cap\mathcal{V}
                    \big)
                \end{equation}
                But for all $\mathcal{U}\in\Delta$ it is true that
                $\mathcal{U}\cap\mathcal{V}\subseteq\mathcal{U}$. But then there
                is a subset
                $\Delta_{\mathcal{U}}\subseteq\mathscr{B}_{\mathcal{U}}$
                \begin{equation}
                    \mathcal{U}\cap\mathcal{V}=
                    \bigcup_{A\in\Delta_{\mathcal{U}}}A
                \end{equation}
                Thus:
                \begin{equation}
                    \mathcal{V}=\bigcup_{\mathcal{U}\in\Delta}\Big(
                        \bigcup_{A\in\Delta_{\mathcal{U}}}A\Big)
                \end{equation}
        \end{proof}
    \section{Topological Manifolds}
        Manifolds are locally Euclidean spaces that have sufficiently nice
        structure to exclude pathalogical examples such as the bug-eyed line
        and the long line. Manifolds are required to have a second-countable
        topology and must also be Hausdorff.
        \begin{fdefinition}{Topological Manifold}{Topological_Manifold}
            A topological manifold of dimension $n\in\mathbb{N}$ is a
            Hausdorff locally Euclidean topological space of dimension $n$
            that is second countable.
        \end{fdefinition}
        \begin{fdefinition}{Atlas}{Atlas}
            An atlas on a topological space $(X,\tau)$ is a set
            $\mathcal{A}$ such that for all $z\in\mathcal{U}$ it is true
            that $z$ is a chart in $(X,\tau)$, and such that for all
            $x\in{X}$ there exists a chart
            $(\mathcal{U},\varphi)\in\mathcal{A}$ such that
            $x\in\mathcal{U}$.
        \end{fdefinition}
        An atlas for a connected space necessarily has a constant and well
        defined dimension, whereas the by definition of a manifold, any
        atlas on a manifold must have the same dimension.
    \section{Smooth Manifolds}
        Smooth manifolds are topological manifolds with a smooth structure
        on them so that one can do calculus. Such objects first require a
        notion of smooth functions, and we define this in terms of the
        familiar notions of smoothness of functions between Euclidean spaces
        $f:\mathbb{R}^{m}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n}$.
        \begin{fdefinition}{Smooth Real-Valued Functions On $\mathbb{R}$}
                           {Smooth_Real_Valued_Functions_on_R}
            A smooth real-valued function on an open subset
            $\mathcal{U}\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is a function
            $f:\mathcal{U}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ such that all mixed partial
            derivatives of all orders exist and are continuous for all
            $\mathbf{x}\in\mathcal{U}$.
        \end{fdefinition}
        $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ can be defined as the set of all functions
        $\mathbf{x}:\mathbb{Z}_{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$. Given an element
        $\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and $k\in\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ we denote
        image of $k$ as $x_{k}=\mathbf{x}(k)$. This is called the $k^{th}$
        coordinate of $\mathbf{x}$. The projection mapping
        $\pi_{k}:\mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ for
        $k\in\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ is the function defined by
        $\pi_{k}(\mathbf{x})=x_{k}$. We can use this notion to define smooth
        functions between arbitrary Euclidean spaces by requiring the
        composition of $f:\mathbb{R}^{m}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with
        $\pi_{k}$ to be smooth for all $k$.
        \begin{fdefinition}{Smooth Euclidean Functions}
                           {Smooth_Euclidean_Functions}
            A smooth function on a subset
            $\mathcal{U}\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{m}$ to $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is a
            function $f:\mathcal{U}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{m}$ such that, for
            all $k\in\mathbb{Z}_{n}$, the function $\pi_{k}\circ{f}$ is a
            smooth real-valued function.
        \end{fdefinition}
        We can use this definition to create a notion of smoothness on a
        manifold by considering charts that overlap \textit{smoothly}.
        \begin{fdefinition}{Smoothly Overlapping Charts}
                               {Smoothly_Overlapping_Charts}
                Smoothly overlapping charts of dimension $n\in\mathbb{N}$ are
                charts $(\mathcal{U}_{1},\varphi_{1})$ and

            If $(X,\tau)$ is a topological space and if $\mathcal{A}$ is a

            there is a unique maximal smooth atlas $\mathcal{C}$ on
            $(X,\tau)$ such that $\mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathcal{C}$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            For let $\mathcal{C}$ be the set of all charts on $(X,\tau)$
            that overlap smoothly with the charts in $\mathcal{A}$. Then
            since $\mathcal{A}$ is an atlas, for all
            $(\mathcal{U},\phi)\in\mathcal{A}$ and for all
            $(\mathcal{V},\xi)\in\mathcal{A}$, we have that
            $(\mathcal{U},\phi)$ and $(\mathcal{V},\xi)$ overlap smoothly,
            and thus $(\mathcal{U},\phi)\in\mathcal{C}$. Therefore
            $\mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathcal{C}$. But $\mathcal{A}$ is an
            atlas and thus for all $x\in{X}$ there is a chart
            $(\mathcal{U},\phi)\in\mathcal{A}$ such that $x\in\mathcal{U}$.
            But $\mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathcal{C}$ and thus
            $(\mathcal{U},\phi)\in\mathcal{C}$. Thus, for all $x\in{X}$ there
            is a chart $(\mathcal{U},\phi)\in\mathcal{C}$ such that
            $x\in\mathcal{U}$. Suppose
            $(\mathcal{U}_{1},\phi_{1}),%
             (\mathcal{U}_{2},\phi_{2})\in\mathcal{C}$.
            If $\mathcal{U}_{1}$ and $\mathcal{U}_{2}$ are disjoint, then
            these two charts overlap smoothly. Suppose it is non-empty and let
            $f$ be the transition function of $(\mathcal{U}_{1},\phi_{1})$ with
            respect to $(\mathcal{U}_{2},\phi_{2})$. Let
            $p\in\phi_{1}(\mathcal{U}_{1}\cap\mathcal{U}_{2})$. But then there
            is a chart $\xi\in\mathcal{A}$ such that $\phi_{2}^{\minus{1}}(p)$
            is contained in the domain of $\xi$. From the associativity of
            composition, we have:
            \begin{equation}
                \phi_{1}\circ\phi_{2}^{\minus{1}}
                =(\phi_{1}\circ\xi^{\minus{1}})\circ
                 (\xi\circ\phi_{2}^{\minus{1}})
            \end{equation}
            But by the definition of $\mathcal{C}$, $\phi_{1}$ and $\phi_{2}$
            overlap smoothly with $\xi$, and thus this is the composition of
            smooth functions, and is therefore smooth. Therefore
            $\phi_{1}\circ\phi_{2}^{\minus{1}}$ is smooth and thus
            $(\mathcal{U}_{1},\phi_{1})$ and $(\mathcal{U}_{2},\phi_{2})$
            overlap smoothly. Thus, $\mathcal{C}$ is a smooth atlas. Moreover,
            it is complete from the construction. Given any other complete
            atlas $\mathcal{C}'$ that contains $\mathcal{A}$ we would have
            $\mathcal{C}\subseteq\mathcal{C}'$ and
            $\mathcal{C}'\subseteq\mathcal{C}$, and therefore
            $\mathcal{C}=\mathcal{C}'$. Thus, this completion is unique.

            A smooth manifold of dimension $n\in\mathbb{N}$, denoted
            $(X,\tau,\mathcal{A})$ is topological manifold $(X,\tau)$ with
            a maximal smooth atlas $\mathcal{A}$ of dimension $n$ on
            $(X,\tau)$.
        \end{fdefinition}
        Any smooth atlas $\mathcal{A}$ on a topological space $(X,\tau)$
        defines a a smooth manifold if we let $\mathcal{C}$ be the maximal
        smooth atlas generated by $\mathcal{A}$.
        \begin{example}
            Let $(\mathbb{R}^{n},\tau_{\mathbb{R}^{n}})$ be the standard
            $n$ dimensional Euclidean space. We can define a trivial smooth
            atlas on this space by let
            $\mathcal{A}=\{(\mathbb{R}^{n},\textrm{id})\}$, where $\textrm{id}$
            is the identity function. This defines a smooth atlas. By
            considering the unique maximal smooth atlas generated by this
            we obtain the standard smooth structure on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$.
        \end{example}
        \begin{theorem}
            If $(X,\tau,\mathcal{A})$ is a smooth manifold of dimension
            $n\in\mathbb{N}$, if $(\mathcal{U},\varphi)$ is a chart in
            $\mathcal{A}$, if $\mathcal{V}\in\tau$, and if
            $\varphi_{\mathcal{V}}$ denotes the restriction mapping:
            $\varphi_{\mathcal{V}}:\mathcal{V}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n}$,
            then $(\mathcal{V},\varphi_{\mathcal{V}})\in\mathcal{A}$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            For since $\phi$ is a homeomorphism from $\mathcal{U}$ to
            $\phi(\mathcal{U})$, and since $\mathcal{V}\in\tau$, we have
            that $\phi_{\mathcal{V}}$ is a homeomorphism between
            $\mathcal{V}$ and $\phi_{\mathcal{V}}(\mathcal{V})$, and
            therefore $(\mathcal{V},\phi_{\mathcal{V}})$ is a chart. But
            this chart meets $(\mathcal{U},\phi)$ smoothly, and $\mathcal{A}$
            is complete. Thus,
            $(\mathcal{V},\phi_{\mathcal{A}})\in\mathcal{A}$.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
            If $n\in\mathbb{N}$, then there is a complete atlas
            $\mathcal{A}$ on $(S^{n},\tau)$, where $\tau$ is the inherited
            topology from $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$.

        \begin{proof}
            For all $k\in\mathbb{Z}_{n+1}$, let $\mathcal{U}_{k}^{+}$ and
            $\mathcal{U}_{k}^{\minus}$ be defined as:

                \end{equation}
            \end{minipage}
            \par\vspace{2.5ex}
            Define $\phi_{\mathcal{U}_{k}^{+}}:\mathcal{U}_{k}^{+}%
                    \rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n}$ by:
            \begin{equation}
                \phi_{\mathcal{U}_{k}^{+}}(\mathbf{x})
                =(x_{1},\,\dots,\,x_{k-1},\,x_{k+1},\,\dots,\,x_{n+1})
            \end{equation}
            That is, the mapping that projects the point onto the plane
            defined by $x_{k}=0$. Define $\phi_{\mathcal{U}_{k}^{\minus}}$
            similarly. Then all such $\phi$ are homeomorphisms from their
            domain to their image. Let $\mathcal{A}$ be defined as follows:
            \begin{equation}
                \mathcal{A}
                =\big\{\,(\mathcal{U}_{k}^{+},\,\phi_{\mathcal{U}_{k}^{+}})
                       \,:\,k\in\mathbb{Z}_{n}\big\}\bigcup
                \big\{\,(\mathcal{U}_{k}^{-},\,\phi_{\mathcal{U}_{k}^{-}})
                       \,:\,k\in\mathbb{Z}_{n}\big\}
            \end{equation}
            Then $\mathcal{A}$ is an atlas of $(S^{n},\tau)$. For if
            $\mathbf{x}\in{S}^{n}$, then $\norm{\mathbf{x}}_{2}=1$. But then
            there is a coordinate $x_{k}$ of $\mathbf{x}$ such that
            $x_{k}\ne{0}$. But then either $x_{k}>0$ or $x_{k}<0$, and thus
            either $\mathbf{x}\in\mathcal{U}_{k}^{+}$ or
            $\mathbf{x}\in\mathcal{U}_{k}^{\minus}$. If
            $(\mathcal{V}_{2},\phi_{2})$ and $(\mathcal{V}_{2},\phi_{2})$
            are charts, then either $\phi_{1}(\mathcal{V}_{1})$
            and $\phi_{2}(\mathcal{V}_{2})$ are disjoint or they are not.
            If they are disjoint, then $\phi_{1}$ and $\phi_{2}$ overlap
            smoothly. If they are not disjoint, let $\mathbf{x}$ be contained
            in the intersection. But then, for all $k\in\mathbb{Z}_{n}$,
            $\pi_{k}\circ(\phi_{1}\circ\phi_{2}^{\minus{1}})$ is smooth,
            and thus $\phi_{1}$ and $\phi_{2}$ overlap smoothly.

        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            For by the previous theorem, $\mathcal{A}_{\mathcal{U}}$ is a
            complete atlas. Moreover, a subspace of a Hausdorff topological
            space is also a Hausdorff topological space, and hence
            $(\mathcal{U},\tau_\mathcal{U})$ is a Hausdorff space. Thus,
            $(\mathcal{U},\tau_\mathcal{U},\mathcal{A}_{\mathcal{U}})$ is
            a smooth manifold.

            $(\mathcal{V},\xi)$ on a topological space $(Y,\tau_{Y})$ is
            the ordered pair $(\mathcal{U}\times\mathcal{V},f)$ where
            $f:\mathcal{U}\times\mathcal{V}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n+m}$
            defined by:

            Where $\phi(p)_{k}$ is the $k^{th}$ coordinate of

            $(\mathcal{U},\phi)\times(\mathcal{V},\xi)$.
        \end{fdefinition}
        Thinking of the elements of $\mathbb{R}^{n+m}$ as tuples of length
        $n+m$, we can write:
        \begin{equation}
            f(p,q)=\big(x_{1}(p),\dots,x_{n}(p),y_{1}(q),\dots,y_{m}(q)\big)

            If $(X,\tau_{X},\mathcal{A}_{X})$ and $(Y,\tau_{Y},\mathcal{A}_{Y})$
            are smooth manifolds, and if $\mathcal{A}$ is the set of all
            product charts on $X\times{Y}$, then $\mathcal{A}$ is a smooth
            atlas on $(X\times{Y},\tau_{X\times{Y}})$, where
            $\tau_{X\times{Y}}$ is the product topology.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            For if $p\in{X}\times{Y}$ then there is an $x\in{X}$ and a
            $y\in{Y}$ such that $p=(x,y)$. But $\mathcal{A}_{X}$ is a smooth
            atlas on $(X,\tau_{X})$, and thus if $x\in{X}$ then there is a
            $(\mathcal{U},\phi)\in\mathcal{A}_{X}$ such that $x\in\mathcal{U}$.
            Similarly, there is a $(\mathcal{V},\xi)\in\mathcal{A}_{Y}$ such
            that $y\in\mathcal{V}$. But then $p\in\mathcal{U}\times\mathcal{V}$,
            and $\mathcal{U}\times\mathcal{V}\in\tau_{X\times{Y}}$. But if
            $\phi:\mathcal{U}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is a homeomorphism
            between $\mathcal{U}$ and $\phi(\mathcal{U})$ and
            $\xi:\mathcal{V}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{m}$ is a homemorphism
            between $\mathcal{V}$ and $\xi(\mathcal{V})$, then
            $f:\mathcal{U}\times\mathcal{V}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n+m}$ is
            a homeomorphism between $\mathcal{U}\times\mathcal{V}$ and
            $f(\mathcal{U}\times\mathcal{V})$, and thus the product chart
            is a chart in $(X\times{Y},\tau_{X\times{Y}})$. Moreover, all of
            the elements of $\mathcal{A}$ are smoothly overlapping. Thus,
            $\mathcal{A}$ is an atlas on $(X\times{Y},\tau_{X\times{Y}})$.
        \end{proof}
        Using the maximal smooth atlas generated by the product atlas
        $\mathcal{A}$ creates the product manifold.

                then $(f\cdot{g}):X\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ defined by:
                \begin{equation}
                    (f\cdot{g})(x)=f(x)\cdot{g}(x)
                    \quad\quad
                    x\in{X}
                \end{equation}
                Is a smooth real-valued function.
            \end{theorem}
            \begin{fdefinition}{Smooth Functions Between Manifolds}
                               {Smooth Functions Between Manifolds}
                A smooth function from a smooth manifold
                $(X,\tau_{X},\mathcal{A}_{X})$ of dimension $m\in\mathbb{N}$
                to a smooth manifold $(Y,\tau_{Y},\mathcal{A}_{Y})$ of
                dimension $n\in\mathbb{N}$ is a function
                $\phi:X\rightarrow{Y}$ such that for every chart
                $(\mathcal{U},\varphi)\in\mathcal{A}_{X}$ and for every
                chart $(\mathcal{V},\psi)\in\mathcal{A}_{Y}$, the function
                $\psi\circ\phi\circ\varphi^{\minus{1}}:\varphi(\mathcal{V})%
                 \rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is a smooth function.
            \end{fdefinition}
            \begin{theorem}
                If $(X,\tau_{X},\mathcal{A}_{X})$ and
                $(Y,\tau_{Y},\mathcal{A}_{Y})$ are manifolds, if
                $A_{X}\subseteq\mathcal{A}_{X}$ is an atlas on $(X,\tau_{X})$,
                if $A_{Y}\subseteq\mathcal{A}_{Y}$ is an atlas on
                $(Y,\tau_{Y})$, and if $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ is a function such
                that, for all $(\mathcal{U},\phi)\in{A}_{X}$ and for all
                $(\mathcal{Y},\xi)\in{A}_{y}$ it is true that
                $\xi\circ{f}\circ\phi^{\minus{1}}:\xi(\mathcal{V})%
                 \rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{m}$ is a smooth Euclidean function,
                then $f$ is smooth.
            \end{theorem}
            \begin{proof}
                Since charts in $\mathcal{A}_{X}$ and $\mathcal{A}_{Y}$
                overlap smoothly with charts in $A_{X}$ and $A_{Y}$, and since
                the atlases $A_{X}$ and $A_{Y}$ cover $X$ and $Y$, respectively,
                we are done.
            \end{proof}
            \begin{theorem}
                If $(X,\tau_{X},\mathcal{A}_{X})$ is a manifold, then
                $\textrm{id}:X\rightarrow{X}$ is a smooth function.
            \end{theorem}
            \begin{theorem}
                If $(X,\tau_{X},\mathcal{A}_{X})$,
                $(Y,\tau_{Y},\mathcal{A}_{Y})$, and
                $(Z,\tau_{Z},\mathcal{A}_{Z})$ are manifolds, if
                $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ and $g:Y\rightarrow{Z}$ are smooth, then
                $g\circ{f}:X\rightarrow{Z}$ is smooth.
            \end{theorem}
            Smoothness is a local property. A function $\phi:M\rightarrow{N}$
            is smooth at $p\in{M}$ if there is a neighborhood
            $\mathcal{U}$ of $p$ such that the restriction of $\phi$ to
            $\mathcal{U}$ is smooth. A smooth function is thus a function
            that is smooth at every point.
            \begin{theorem}
                If $(X,\mathcal{A}_{X},\tau_{X})$ and
                $(Y,\mathcal{A}_{Y},\tau_{Y})$ are manifolds and if
                $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ is smooth, then $f$ is continuous.
            \end{theorem}
            \begin{fdefinition}{Diffeomorphism}{Diffeomorphism}
                A diffeomorphism from a manifold
                $(X,\tau_{X},\mathcal{A}_{X})$ to a manifold
                $(Y,\tau_{Y},\mathcal{A}_{Y})$ is a bijective function
                $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ such that $f$ and $f^{\minus{1}}$ are
                smooth.
            \end{fdefinition}
            \begin{example}
                For any $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$ with $a<b$, the interval
                $(a,b)$ is diffeomorphic to the unit interval $(0,1)$. For
                let $\phi:(0,1)\rightarrow(a,b)$ be defined by:
                \begin{equation}
                    \phi(t)=(a-b)t+b
                \end{equation}
                Then $\phi$ is a smooth bijection and it's inverse is
                smooth. Moreover, the unit interval is diffeomorphic to
                $\mathbb{R}$. For let $\xi:(0,1)\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ be
                defined by:
                \begin{equation}
                    \xi(t)=\frac{2t}{t(1-t)}
                \end{equation}
            \end{example}
            \begin{theorem}
                If $(X,\tau_{X},\mathcal{A}_{X})$ and
                $(Y,\tau_{Y},\mathcal{A}_{Y})$ are manifolds, and if
                $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ is a diffeomorphism, then $f$ is a
                homeomorphism from $(X,\tau_{X})$ to $(Y,\tau_{Y})$.
            \end{theorem}
            \begin{proof}
                For if $f$ is a diffeomorphism, then it is a smooth bijection
                such that it's inverse is smooth. But if $f$ is smooth, then
                it is continuous and therefore it is a continuous bijection.
                But if $f^{\minus{1}}$ is smooth, then it is continuous, and
                thus $f$ is a bicontinuous bijective function, and is therefore
                a homeomorphism.
            \end{proof}
            A smooth homeomorphism need not be a diffeomorphism. The inverse
            function may not be smooth. For let
            $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ be defined by $f(x)=x^{3}$.
            Then $f$ is a homeomorphism and it's forward direction is smooth,
            but $f^{\minus{1}}$ is not smooth at the origin.
            \begin{theorem}
                If $A$ is a set, if $(X,\tau,\mathcal{A})$ is a manifold, and
                if $f:A\rightarrow{X}$ is an bijective function, then there
                exists a topology $\tau_{A}$ and an atlas $\mathcal{A}_{A}$
                on $X$ such that $f$ is a diffeomorphism.
            \end{theorem}
    \section{Manifolds}
        \begin{definition}
            An $n$ dimensional smooth manifold is a topological space $(M,\tau)$
            equipped with a collection $\mathcal{A}$ or ordered pairs
            $\{(\mathcal{U}_{\alpha},\varphi_{\alpha})\}$ such that
            $\mathcal{U}_{\alpha}$ are open and cover the space, and such that
            $\varphi_{\alpha}:\mathcal{U}_{\alpha}\rightarrow\mathcal{V}_{\alpha}$
            is a homeomorphism to an open subset $\mathcal{V}_{\alpha}$ of
            $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and such that for when
            $\mathcal{U}_{\alpha}\cap\mathcal{U}_{\beta}\ne\emptyset$, the
            functions $\varphi_{\beta}\circ\varphi_{\alpha}^{\minus{1}}$
            are smooth.
        \end{definition}
        The notion of smoothness here is simply the smoothness of functions
        from $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ to itself. The collection $\mathcal{A}$ is called
        an atlas and $(\mathcal{U},\varphi)$ are called charts.
        \begin{example}
            If $\mathcal{U}$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and
            $f:\mathcal{U}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is smooth, then the
            graph of $f$ is a smooth manifold.
        \end{example}
        \begin{example}
            If $\mathcal{U}\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is open, if
            $f:\mathcal{U}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is smooth, if $c$ is in the
            range of $f$, and if $\textrm{grad}(f)$ is non-zero on all of
            $f^{\minus{1}}(c)$, then $f^{\minus{1}}(c)$ is a smooth manifold.
        \end{example}
        \begin{example}
            Define $f:\mathbb{R}^{3}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ by
            $f(\mathbf{x})=\norm{\mathbf{x}}_{2}^{2}$. For all
            $\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^{3}$ such that $\norm{\mathbf{x}}=1$ we
            have $\textrm{grad}(f)\ne{0}$, and thus $f^{\minus{1}}(\{1\})$ is a
            smooth manifold. This is the unit sphere.
        \end{example}
        \begin{example}
            The orthographic projection of the sphere maps:
            \begin{equation}
                (x,y)\mapsto(x,y,\sqrt{1-x^{2}-y^{2}})
            \end{equation}
            The stereographic projection also exists.
        \end{example}
        \begin{definition}
            The product manifold of manifolds $M_{1},\hdots,M_{k}$, where
            $M_{j}$ is an $n_{j}$ smooth manifold then
            $M=\prod_{j=1}^{k}M_{j}$ has a natural structure of an
            $n=n_{1}+\dots+n_{k}$ dimensional manifold.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{definition}
            The quotient manifold of a smooth manifold $M$ with an equivalence
            relation $\sim$ is a manifold structure on $M/\sim$ with the
            quotient topology. In particular when we have group actions.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{example}
            Consider the sphere $S^{2}$ with the equivalence relation $R$
            defined by $pRq$ if and only if $p=\pm{q}$. The quotient space
            $S^{2}/R$ is the real projective plane $\mathbb{RP}^{2}$. We can
            consider this by means of a group action on $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ on
            $S^{2}$. Define $g\cdot{p}$ by $1\cdot{p}=p$ and
            $\minus{1}\cdot{p}=\minus{p}$. This is a group action of
            $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ on $S^{2}$.
        \end{example}
        All of the examples thus far have been subsets of some Euclidean space
        $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. One natural question is whether or not there are
        smooth manifolds that do no live in some higher dimensional Euclidean
        space. That is, are there manifolds $M$ such that $M$ can not be
        embedded into some $\mathbb{R}^{m}$?
        \begin{definition}
            A function $\phi:M\rightarrow{N}$ is smooth if for all $p\in{M}$
            there is a chart $(\mathcal{U},\varphi)$ containing $p$ and a
            chart $(\mathcal{V},\psi)$ containing $\phi(p)$ such that
            $\psi\circ\phi\circ\varphi^{\minus{1}}$ is smooth.
        \end{definition}
        Studying maps between manifolds gives us new manifolds to study. In
        particular, there are submersions and embeddings, and in particular
        embedded submanifolds.
        \par\hfill\par
        Tangent spaces are another important topic in differential topology. The
        classic example is that of a sphere $S^{2}$ in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$. We draw
        the tangent plane to a point on a sphere, which is the best linear
        approximation of the sphere at that point. This notion relies on an
        ambient space (that of $\mathbb{R}^{3}$), but since we do not yet know
        if all manifolds can be embedded into such an ambient space, we need a
        new means of defining tangent spaces that agrees with our intuition.
        There are several ways of thinking of this:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Tangent vectors are derivations on $C^{\infty}(p)$.
            \item Tangent vectors are equivalence classes of curves through $p$.
        \end{itemize}
        Given a function $\phi:M\rightarrow{N}$ that is smooth between two
        manifolds, there is a function $\diff\phi_{o}:T_{p}M\rightarrow{T}_{p}N$
        between these tangent spaces. We can further consider the collection of
        all tangent spaces at all points $p$ of $M$, forming the tangent bundle
        of $M$, denoted $TM$. Set theoretically, this is the disjoint union
        $TM=\coprod_{p}T_{p}M$, but we do \textbf{not} give this the disjoint
        union topology. There is a natural topology that can be endowed on $TM$.
        \begin{example}
            If we take $S^{1}$, the tangent bundle is
            $TM=S^{1}\times\mathbb{R}$. This is an example of a trivial bundle.
            Most tangent bundles are not of this form. That is, for an $m$
            dimensional manifold $M$, $TM$ is usual \textbf{not} equal to
            $M\times\mathbb{R}^{m}$. It will always have dimension $2m$.
        \end{example}
    \section{A Review of Topology}
        \begin{definition}
            Let $X$ be a set. A topology on $X$ is a collection $\tau$
            consisting of subsets of $X$ such that $\emptyset\in\tau$,
            $X\in\tau$, and $\tau$ is closed to arbitrary unions and finite
            intersections. The elements of $\tau$ are called the open sets of
            $X$. $(X,\tau)$ is called a topological space. The closed subsets
            of $X$ are sets of the form $X\setminus\mathcal{U}$, where
            $\mathcal{U}$ is open. That is, a set is closed if its complement is
            open.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{example}
            The discrete topology $\mathcal{P}(X)$, the power set on $X$, is
            always a topology. So is $\{\emptyset,X\}$, the trivial topology.
        \end{example}
        \begin{example}
            If $(X,d)$ is a metric space, and if $\mathcal{U}\subseteq{X}$ is
            such that for all $x\in\mathcal{U}$ there is an $\varepsilon>0$
            such that $B_{\varepsilon}(x)\subseteq\mathcal{U}$, then we call
            $\mathcal{U}$ open. The collection of all such sets forms a topology
            on $X$, called the metric topology.
        \end{example}
        \begin{definition}
            The interior of a subset $S\subseteq{X}$ of a topology space
            $(X,\tau)$ is the set $\textrm{Int}(X)$ defined to by the
            set of all $s\in{S}$ such that there is an open set
            $\mathcal{U}\subseteq{X}$ such that $s\in\mathcal{U}$ and
            $\mathcal{U}\subseteq{S}$.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{definition}
            The closure of a subset $S\subseteq{X}$ in a topological space
            $(X,\tau)$ is the intersection of all closed sets in $X$ that
            contain $S$, denoted $\textrm{Cl}(S)$.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{definition}
            A subset subset of $X$ is a set $S$ such that
            $\textrm{Cl}(S)=X$.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{definition}
            A continuous function is a function $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ such that
            for all open $\mathcal{V}\subseteq{Y}$, the pre-image
            $f^{\minus{1}}(\mathcal{V})$ is open in $X$.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{definition}
            A homeomorphism is a bijective continuous function
            $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ such that $f^{\minus{1}}$ is continuous.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{definition}
            A compact space is such that every open cover has a finite subcover.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{definition}
            A connected topological space is such that it can't be written as
            the non-trivial union of disjoint open subsets.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{definition}
            Path connected, for all $x,y\in{X}$ there is a continuous function
            $\gamma:[0,1]\rightarrow{X}$ such that $\gamma(0)=x$ and
            $\gamma(1)=y$.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{definition}
            A Hausdorff space, for all $x,y\in{X}$ there are disjoint open
            $\mathcal{U},\mathcal{V}$ such that $x\in\mathcal{U}$ and
            $y\in\mathcal{V}$.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{definition}
            A basis, collection $\mathscr{B}$ such that for all
            $\mathcal{U}\in\tau$, $\tau$ can be written as the union of the
            elements of $\mathscr{B}$.
        \end{definition}
        \subsection{New Spaces from Old}
            \begin{definition}
                Given a topological space $(X,\tau)$, and a subset
                $A\subseteq{X}$, the subspace topology is the topology
                $\tau_{A}$ defined by
                $\tau_{A}=\{A\cap\mathcal{U}|\mathcal{U}\in\tau\}$.
            \end{definition}
            \begin{definition}
                The product of spaces is a thing.
            \end{definition}
            \begin{definition}
                The quotient space of $(X,\tau)$ with respect to a set $Y$ and
                a surjective map $\pi:X\rightarrow{Y}$ is the topology generated
                by $\pi$ such that it is continuous.
            \end{definition}
            More generally, let $X$ be a topological space and $G$ a topological
            group with a product $G\times{X}\rightarrow{X}$ satisfying:
            \begin{align}
                (g_{1}*{g}_{2})\cdot{x}&=g_{1}\cdot(g_{2}\cdot{x})\\
                e*x&=x
            \end{align}
            We can define an equivalence relation $R$ by $pRq$ if there is a
            $g\in{G}$ such that $p=g\cdot{q}$. This gives us a quotient space.
            \begin{example}
                Consider $X=S^{2}$, the sphere, with $G=S^{1}$ as a group.
                Then $X/G$ is simply the unit interval.
            \end{example}
            Draw this out, the orbits are lattitudinal lines, plus the two
            poles.
        \subsection{Quotient Maps}
            Let $\pi:X\rightarrow{Y}$ be a quotient map (surjective and
            continuous). A set $C\subseteq{Y}$ is closed if and only if
            $\pi^{\minus{1}}(C)$ is closed in $X$. The composition of quotient
            maps is a quotient map. If $F$ is continuous, $F\circ\pi$ from $X$
            to $B$ is continuous.
    \section{Topological Manifold}
        \begin{definition}
            A topological space is said to be an $n$ dimensional topological
            manifold if the following hold:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item $M$ is Hausdorff.
                \item $M$ is second countable.
                \item $M$ is locally Euclidean of dimension $n$. For all
                      $p\in{M}$ there is an open set $\mathcal{U}$ and a
                      homeomorphism $\varphi:\mathcal{U}\rightarrow\mathcal{V}$
                      to an open subset $\mathcal{V}\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{n}$.
            \end{itemize}
            The pair $(\mathcal{U},\varphi)$ is called a chart. If the image of
            $\mathcal{U}$ by $\varphi$ is an open ball in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ we
            call this a coordinate ball.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{example}
            Open subsets of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ are $n$ dimensional manifolds.
            Moreover, any open subset of an $n$ dimensional manifold, given the
            subspace topology, will again be an $n$ dimensional manifold.
        \end{example}
        \begin{example}
            The graphs of continuous functions $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ from
            topological manifolds of dimension $n$ and $m$, repsectively, are
            manifolds. That is, if $\mathcal{U}\subseteq{X}$ is open, and
            $f|_{\mathcal{U}}$ is the restriction of $f$, then
            $\{(p,f(p)|p\in\mathcal{U}\}$, equipped with the subspace topology
            induced by the product topology on $X\times{Y}$, is a topological
            manifold of dimesnion $n$. It is Hausdorff and second countable
            since it is the subspace of such spaces.
        \end{example}
        \subsection{Review of Previous Lecture}
            \subsubsection{Subspace Topology}
                Let $X$ be a topological space with topology $\tau$. For any
                $S\subseteq{X}$ let $\tau_{S}$ be the subspace topology:
                \begin{equation}
                    \tau_{S}=\{\mathcal{U}\cap{S}\;|\;\mathcal{U}\in\tau\}
                \end{equation}
                Then $\tau_{S}$ is a topology on $S$, called the subspace
                topology. The restriction of a continuous map
                $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ to $S$ is continuous with respect to the
                subspace topology on $f(S)\subseteq{Y}$. If $f|_{S}$ is
                continuous, then $f:X\rightarrow{f}(X)$ is continuous with the
                subspace topology.
            \subsubsection{Basis for a Topology}
                Let $\mathscr{B}$ be a bsis for a topology on $X$. Then:
                \begin{equation}
                    \tau(\mathscr{B})=\{\mathcal{U}\subseteq{X}\;|\;
                        \forall_{x\in\mathcal{U}}\exists_B\in\mathscr{B}:
                        x\in{B}\subseteq\mathcal{U}\}
                \end{equation}
                is a topology on $X$, and this is the topology generated by
                $\mathscr{B}$. If $X_{1},\dots,X_{n}$ are topological spaces,
                $X=\prod{X}_{k}$ is the product space generated by the
                \textit{open rectangles} in the $X_{i}$.
            \subsection{Continuous Maps and Products}
                Let $X$, $Y_{1},\dots,Y_{n}$ be topological spaces, and let
                $Y=\prod_{k}Y_{k}$ be the product topological space. For each
                $k$ let $\pi_{k}:Y\rightarrow{Y}_{k}$ be the projection mapping
                sending $\mathbf{y}\in{Y}$ to $y_{k}$, then $k^{th}$ component
                of $\mathbf{y}$. Then $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ is continuous if and
                only if $\pi_{k}\circ{f}$ is continuous for each $k$. Going the
                other way, if $X=\prod_{k}X_{k}$ and $F:X\rightarrow{Y}$,
                $F=f_{1}\times\cdots\times{f}_{n}$, then it is continuous if and
                only if $f_{k}$ is continuous for all $k$. Let
                $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ be a continuous function. Note that from the
                definition of a function, $f\subseteq{X}\times{Y}$. Thus we can
                endow $f$ with the subspace topology on the product topology of
                $X\times{Y}$. This is occasionally called the \textit{graph} of
                $f$. If $X$ and $Y$ are Hausdorff and second countable, then
                $X\times{Y}$ is, and thus any subspace of $X\times{Y}$ is
                also Hausdorff and second countable. Hence the graph of $f$ is
                a second countable Hausdorff topological space.
                \begin{example}
                    The $n$ sphere $S^{n}$ is the subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$
                    such that $\norm{\mathbf{x}}_{2}=1$, equipped with the
                    subspace topology. We can make it into a manifold with the
                    charts $(\mathcal{U}_{k}^{\pm},\phi_{k}^{\pm})$ where
                    $\mathcal{U}_{k}^{\pm}$ is the $k^{th}$ upper (or lower)
                    hemisphere, and $\phi_{k}^{\pm}$ is simply the projection
                    mapping onto the hyperplane $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. We can also
                    cover this with two simpler coordinate charts, the
                    two stereographic projections about the north and south
                    pole.
                \end{example}
                \begin{example}
                    The real projective space $\mathbb{RP}^{n}$ is another
                    manifold. For any $x,y\in\mathbb{R}^{n+1}\setminus\{0\}$,
                    we write $xRy$ if there is a $t\in\mathbb{R}$ such that
                    $x=ty$. That is, $x$ and why are equivalent if they lie on
                    the same line through the origin. We define
                    $\mathbb{RP}^{n}$ by $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}\setminus\{0\}/R$,
                    equipped with the quotient topology. That is, a subset is
                    open if and only if $\pi^{\minus{1}}(\mathcal{U})$ is open
                    where $\pi$ is the quotient map (the natural projection).
                    For any $k=1,\dots,n$, let $\tilde{\mathcal{U}}_{j}$ be the
                    $(x_{1},\dots,x_{n+1})\in\mathbb{R}^{n+1}\setminus\{0\}$
                    such that $x_{j}\ne{0}$. This is an open subset and it is
                    saturated with respect to $\pi$. That is, for all
                    $[x]\in\mathbb{RP}^{n}$,
                    $\pi^{\minus{1}}([x])\cap\tilde{\mathcal{U}}_{j}\ne\emptyset$
                    if and only if $\pi^{\minus{1}}([x])\subseteq\tilde{\mathcal{U}}_{j}$.
                    Now let $\mathcal{U}=\pi(\tilde{\mathcal{U}}_{j})$. Then
                    since $\tilde{\mathcal{U}}_{j}$ is saturated it is equal
                    to $\pi^{\minus{1}}(\mathcal{U}_{j})$ and is therefore
                    open in the quotient topology. Define $\varphi_{j}$ by:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \varphi_{j}\big([(x_{1},\dots,x_{n+1})]\big)
                        =\big(\frac{x_{1}}{x_{j}},\dots,
                            \frac{x_{j-1}}{x_{j}},\frac{x_{j+1}}{x_{j}},\dots,
                            \frac{x_{n+1}}{x_{j}}\big)
                    \end{equation}
                    Then this map commutes with $\pi$ with $\tilde{\varphi}$:
                    $\tilde{\varphi}=\varphi\circ\pi$.
                \end{example}
    \section{Topological Groups}
        \begin{definition}
            A topological Lie group is a group $(G,*)$ with a topology $\tau$ on
            $G$ such that $\nu:G\rightarrow{G}$ defined by
            $\nu(g)=g^{\minus{1}}$ is continuous $*:G\times{G}\rightarrow{G}$ is
            continuous in the product topology, and $(G,\tau)$ is a topological
            manifold.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{theorem}
            $GL_{n}(\mathbb{R})$ is a topological Lie group of dimension
            $n^{2}$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            For we have:
            \begin{equation}
                GL_{n}(\mathbb{R})=
                \textrm{det}^{\minus{1}}(\mathbb{R}\setminus\{0\})
            \end{equation}
            and since $\textrm{det}$ is continuous (it's a polynomial), it's
            thus an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n^{2}}$ (we can identify
            $n\times{n}$ matrices with points in $\mathbb{R}^{n^{2}}$). Moreover
            multiplication is continuous since it's continuous in every slot,
            it's a polynomial. The inverse function
        \end{proof}
    \section{More on Topological Manifolds}
        \begin{definition}
            A precompact subset of a topological space $(X,\tau)$ is a subset
            $\mathcal{U}\subseteq{X}$ such that $\textrm{Cl}(\mathcal{U})$
            is compact.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{theorem}
            Every topological $n$ manifold has a countable basis of precompact
            coordinate balls.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            Let $(X,\tau)$ be a topological manifold and
            $\{(\mathcal{U}_{\alpha},\varphi_{\alpha})\}$ a cover by coordinate
            charts. Since second countable spaces are Lindelof, there is a
            countable subcover. Since each $\varphi_{k}$ is an open mapping,
            $\varphi_{k}(\mathcal{U}_{k})$ is an open subset of
            $\mathbb{R}^{n}$.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{definition}
            A locally path connected topological space is a topological space
            $(X,\tau)$ such that there exists a basis of path connected open
            sets.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{definition}
            A locally compact topological space is such that for all $x\in{X}$
            there is an open $\mathcal{U}\subseteq{X}$ and a compact
            $K\subseteq{X}$ such that $x\in\mathcal{U}$ and
            $\mathcal{U}\subseteq{K}$.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{definition}
            A connected component of $X$ is a maximal connected subset of $X$.
        \end{definition}
        Connected components partition the space. If two connected sets have
        a point in common, their union is connected.
        \begin{definition}
            A path connected component s a maximal path component.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{theorem}
            If $(X,\tau)$ is a topological manifold, then $M$ is locally path
            connected, locally compact, and the path components and connected
            components are identical. Moreover, $M$ has countably many connected
            components, each of which is open.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            Locally path connected and connected implies path connected, hence
            connected components and path connected components are the same.
            Locally compact since compact coordinate balls about each point
            suffice. Countably many connected components since second countable.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{definition}
            A locally finite subset $\mathcal{O}\subseteq\mathcal{P}(X)$ is a
            collection such that for all $x\in{X}$ there is a neighborhood
            $\mathcal{U}\in\tau$ such that $\mathcal{U}$ intersects at most
            finitely many elements of $\mathcal{O}$.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{definition}
            A refinitement of a collection $\mathcal{O}\subseteq\mathcal{P}(X)$
            is a collection $\mathcal{D}\subseteq\mathcal{P}(X)$ such that for
            all $\mathcal{V}\in\mathcal{D}$ there is a
            $\mathcal{U}\in\mathcal{O}$ such that
            $\mathcal{V}\subseteq\mathcal{U}$.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{definition}
            A paracompact space is a space such that every open cover has a
            locally finite refinement.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{theorem}
            If $\mathcal{O}$ is a locally finite collection of subsets of $X$,
            then the collection of the closures is locally finite and the union
            of the closures is the closure of the unions.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{theorem}
            If $(X,\tau)$ is a topological manifold, then it is paracompact.
        \end{theorem}
    \section{Smooth Manifolds}
        \begin{definition}
            A diffeomprhism from an open subset
            $\mathcal{U}\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{n}$ to an open subset
            $\mathcal{V}\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is a homeomorphism
            $f:\mathcal{U}\rightarrow\mathcal{V}$ such that $f$ and
            $f^{\minus{1}}$ are smooth functions.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{definition}
            Let $M$ an $n$ dimensional topological manifold. Two coordinate
            charts $(\mathcal{U},\varphi)$ and $(\mathcal{V},\psi)$ are said to
            be $C^{\infty}$ compatible if $\psi\circ\phi^{\minus{1}}$,
            defined as a function from $\varphi(\mathcal{U}\cap\mathcal{V})$ to
            $\psi(\mathcal{U}\cap\mathcal{V})$, is a diffeomprhism.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{definition}
            Let $M$ be an $n$ dimensional topological manifold. A smooth atlas
            on $M$ is a collection $\mathcal{A}$ of charts
            $(\mathcal{U},\varphi)$ that cover $M$ and such that all charts
            are smoothly compatible. A smooth atlas $\mathcal{A}$ on $M$ is
            called maximal if it is not contained in any strictly larger
            smooth atlas. A smooth structure on $M$ is a maximal smooth atlas.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{definition}
            A smooth manifold is a topological manifold $(X,\tau)$ with a
            smooth structure $\mathcal{A}$.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{theorem}
            If $M$ is an $n$ dimensional topological manifold, and if
            $\mathcal{A}$ is a smooth atlas on $M$, then there is a unique
            maximal atlas $\mathcal{A}'$ such that
            $\mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathcal{A}'$.
        \end{theorem}

    \section{Reading From Lee (Chapter 1)}
        Smoothness cannot be a topological property. To see this, note that the
        circle and the square are homeomorphic to each other, and thus topology
        cannot distinguish between the two. They different in the smooth sense
        since one has sharp corners (the square) and the other does not. We can
        be explicit, let
        $\varphi:\mathbb{R}^{2}\setminus\{0\}\rightarrow{S}^{1}$ be the mapping:
        \begin{equation}
            \varphi(\mathbf{x})=\frac{\mathbf{x}}{\norm{\mathbf{x}}}
        \end{equation}
        The restriction of $\varphi$ to the square will then be a homemorphism
        (Fig.~\ref{fig:Homeomorphism_Square_to_Circle}).

        \begin{definition}
            A topological $n$ manifold is a topological space $(X,\tau)$ that is
            Hausdorff, second-countable, and for all $p\in{X}$ there is an open
            subset $\mathcal{U}\subseteq{X}$ such that $p\in\mathcal{U}$ and
            $\mathcal{U}$ is homeomorphic to an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{theorem}
            A topological space $(X,\tau)$ is a topological manifold if and only
            if if is Hausdorff, second countable, and for all $p\in{X}$ there is
            an open subset $\mathcal{U}\subseteq{X}$ such that $p\in\mathcal{U}$
            and $\mathcal{U}$ is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^{n}$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            If every point in $X$ is contained in an open set $\mathcal{U}$ that
            is homeomorphic to all of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, then it is a topological
            manifold since $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is an open subset of
            $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Going the other direction, suppose $(X,\tau)$ is a
            topological manifold and $p\in{X}$. Then there is an open subset
            $\mathcal{U}$ such that $p\in\mathcal{U}$ and $\mathcal{U}$ is
            homeomorphic to an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. That is, there
            is a $\mathcal{V}\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and a homemorphism
            $\varphi:\mathcal{U}\rightarrow\mathcal{V}$. But since
            $p\in\mathcal{U}$ and $\varphi:\mathcal{U}\rightarrow\mathcal{V}$,
            it is then true that $\varphi(p)\in\mathcal{V}$. But $\mathcal{V}$
            is open, and thus there is an $r>0$ such that
            $B_{r}^{\mathbb{R}^{n}}(\varphi(p))\subseteq\mathcal{V}$. That is,
            there is an $r>0$ such that the $r$ ball centered about $\varphi(p)$
            is contained in $\mathcal{V}$. But $\varphi$ is a homeomorphism, and
            thus $\varphi^{\minus{1}}$ is a homeomorphism. And the restriction
            of a homeomorphism to a subspace is again a homeomorphism in the
            subspace topologies. Thus,
            $\varphi^{\minus{1}}|_{B_{r}^{\mathbb{R}^{n}}(\varphi(p))}$ is a
            homeomorphism from $B_{r}^{\mathbb{R}^{n}}(\varphi(p))$ to its
            image. But it's image is simply
            $\varphi^{\minus{1}}(B_{r}^{\mathbb{R}^{n}}(\varphi(p)))$, which is
            open since $\varphi$ is continuous. Thus, there is an open subset of
            $(X,\tau)$ that contains $p$ which is homeomorphic to an open ball
            in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. But any open ball in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is
            homeomorphic to all of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, and since homeomorphic is
            an equivalence relation, there is thus an open subset containing $p$
            that is homeomorphic to all of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{example}
            All of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is itself a topological $n$ dimensional
            manifold. It is Hausdorff since it is a metric space, given two
            points a distance $d$ away one can choose open balls of radius
            $d/4$ about each point as disjoint open neighborhoods, ensuring the
            Hausdorff property. Moreover, it is second countable since the set
            of all balls with rational radii centered about rational points
            (elements of $\mathbb{Q}^{n}$) form a countable basis for the
            topology on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Hence it is Hausdorff and second
            countable. That any point $\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is contained
            in an open subset homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ can be seen by
            letting $\mathcal{U}=\mathbb{R}^{n}$. That is, take as the open
            subset the entire space. Therefore, $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is a
            topological manifold.
        \end{example}
        \begin{example}
            In the previous example we implicitly thought of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ as
            being equipped with the standard Euclidean topology. This is the
            topology that arises from the Pythagorean distance function:
            \begin{equation}
                d_{2}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=
                \sqrt{\sum_{k\in\mathbb{Z}_{n}}(x_{k}-y_{k})^{2}}
            \end{equation}
            What if we change the metric? Any metric on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ will
            preserve the Hausdorff property, since all metric spaces are
            Hausdorff, however the discrete metric loses the second countability
            property, and hence cannot be considered a topological manifold
            (although it is still locally \textit{zero} dimensional). What about
            the metrics that arise from the $\norm{\cdot}_{p}$ norm:
            \begin{equation}
                d_{p}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=
                \Big(\sum_{k\in\mathbb{Z}_{n}}(x_{k}-y_{k})^{p}\Big)^{1/p}
            \end{equation}
            For $1\leq{p}\leq\infty$ this will be second countable and Hausdorff
            and since these metrics are equivalent, they will induce the same
            topology, and hence will be topological manifolds of dimension $n$.
            However the case of $n=1$ and $n=\infty$ are somewhat peculiar. An
            open ball in the $\norm{\cdot}_{1}$ norm looks like a diamond,
            whereas in $\norm{\cdot}_{\infty}$ the open balls are squares. So
            while all of these metrics give rise to the same topological
            structure, they create a different \textit{smooth} structure on the
            space. When one considers $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ it is standard to assume
            the Euclidean $\norm{\cdot}_{2}$ norm (and the structure induced by
            it) is being considered. That is, open balls
            $B_{r}^{(\mathbb{R}^{n},\norm{\cdot}_{2})}(\mathbf{x})$ are just the
            interiors of $n$ dimensional spheres.
        \end{example}
        The Hausdorff condition is to exclude bizarre spaces such as the
        bug-eyed line and the branching line. The second countability criterion
        ensures the space won't be massive. For example, the uncountable
        disjoint union of spheres will be Hausdorff and locally Euclidean, but
        not second countable (but it will be first countable). This space isn't
        too horrible since it's metrizable (in the disjoint union topology). A
        more pathalogical example is the long line, occasionally denoted
        $[0,\omega_{1})$, defined as $[0,1)\times\omega_{1}$ with the dictionary
        or lexicographic ordering. Here $\omega_{1}$ denotes the first
        uncountable ordinal. This space is not metrizable, but it is Hausdorff
        and locally Euclidean (it is locally like $\mathbb{R}$), but it is
        not second countable. One of the nice theorems from topology is the
        Smirnov metrization theorem which states that a topological space is
        metrizable if and only if it is locally metrizable, Hausdorff, and
        paracompact. Every locally Euclidean space is automatically locally
        metrizable since we can steal the Euclidean metric on small enough
        neighborhoods about every point.
        \par\hfill\par
        The second countability condition allows one to prove paracompactness,
        and thus every topological manifold is automatically metrizable by the
        Smirnov theorem. This is perhaps one justification for the second
        countability condition. Note that the metric that we can place on the
        topological manifold $(X,\tau)$ may not give us much geometrical
        information, but simply allows us to apply the results of the theory of
        metric spaces without much thought. For example, topological manifolds
        must be regular, normal, perfectly normal Hausdorff, we may apply
        Urysohn's lemma and Tietze extension theorem should the need arise, and
        more. Moreover, from an analytical point of view, we have that functions
        are continuous if and only if there are sequentially continuous (i.e.
        $a_{n}\rightarrow{x}$ implies $f(a_{n})\rightarrow{f}(x)$) and compact
        if and only if sequentially compact. So while the metric does not
        necessarily have much to do with the structure we care about, it's
        existence gives us this plethora of data for free.
        \begin{example}
            Consider the sphere $S^{2}$. We can place a natural metric on this
            by defining the distance to be the length of the shortest curve
            connecting two points. One can prove the shortest curve exists and
            that it lies on the great circle between the two points (the circle
            containing the two points with the center of the sphere as the
            origin). This function is symmetric, positive definite, and obeys
            the triangle inequality and is therefore a metric. However, if we
            were to take two disjoint spheres, how can we metrize this? There's
            one way, defining:
            \begin{equation}
                d(x,y)=
                \begin{cases}
                    d_{1}(x,y),&x,y\in{S}_{1}^{2}\\
                    d_{2}(x,y),&x,y\in{S}_{2}^{2}\\
                    4,&\textrm{Otherwise}
                \end{cases}
            \end{equation}
            where $S_{i}^{2}$ is the $i^{th}$ sphere and $d_{i}$ is the
            \textit{geodesic} metric described above on the respective spheres.
            For the case of when the points lie in separate sphere we've chosen
            the constant 4 since this is greater than the furthest two points
            can be on the unit sphere (which is $\pi$, half of the perimeter
            $2\pi$). Doing this enures $d$ is a metric. So while intuitively we
            want to thing of the disjoint union of two spheres as a two
            dimesnional topological space, the metric that can induce the
            topology seems somewhat irrelevant to the picture we have in mind. 
        \end{example}
        Before continuing it is perhaps important to note that paracompactness
        does not imply second countable. Again, the disjoint union of spheres
        serves as an example.
        \begin{definition}
            A chart of dimension $n\in\mathbb{N}$ in a topological space
            $(X,\tau)$ is an open set $\mathcal{U}\in\tau$ and a function
            $\varphi:\mathcal{U}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n}$ such that $\varphi$
            is continuous, injective, and an open mapping. A chart is denoted
            $(\mathcal{U},\varphi)$.
        \end{definition}
        Equivalently, we could say that $\varphi$ is a homeomorphism onto its
        image or that $\varphi:\mathcal{U}\rightarrow\mathcal{V}$ is a
        homeomorphism where $\mathcal{V}\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is open. The
        definition adopted here is so that all of the details about a chart
        $(\mathcal{U},\varphi)$ are embedded in the notation. That is, we need
        not add a $\mathcal{V}$ nor talk about $\varphi^{\minus{1}}$.

            \caption{A Chart in a Topological Space}
            \label{fig:Chart_in_Topological_Space}
        \end{figure}
        Another equivalent definition of topological manifold is that for all
        $x\in{X}$ there is a chart $(\mathcal{U},\varphi)$ such that
        $x\in\mathcal{U}$.
        \begin{definition}
            The coordinate functions of a chart $(\mathcal{U},\varphi)$ of
            dimension $n\in\mathbb{N}$ in a topological space $(X,\tau)$
            are the function $x^{i}:X\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ defined by
            $x^{i}=\varphi\circ\pi_{i}$, where
            $\pi_{i}:\mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is the $i^{th}$
            projection mapping.
        \end{definition}
        With this definition it is often common to write the image of a point
        $p\in\mathcal{U}$ by:
        \begin{equation}
            \varphi(p)=\big(x^{1}(p),x^{2}(p),\dots,x^{n-1}(p),x^{n}(p)\big)
        \end{equation}
        One should note that $x^{2}$ does not denote the square of $x$, and this
        may cause confusion. It is the composition of $\varphi$ with the map
        $\pi_{2}:\mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ which simply selects the
        second coordinate.
        \begin{example}
            The graph of a continuous function
            $f:\mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{m}$ is an $n$ dimensional
            manifold. That is, recalling from set theory that a function
            $f:\mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{m}$ is a subset
            $f\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{n}\times\mathbb{R}^{m}$, if we endow $f$ with
            the subspace topology of $\mathbb{R}^{n+m}$, then it will be an
            $n$ dimensional manifold. To see this, for
            $(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\in{f}$, let
            $\pi_{1}:\mathbb{R}^{n+m}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n}$ be the mapping
            $\pi_{1}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=\mathbf{x}$. This is continuous, and
            thus the restriction $\pi_{1}|_{f}:f\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is
            continuous in the subspace topology (that is, in the graph of $f$).
            Moreover, $\varphi|_{f}$ is a homeomorphism with continuous inverse
            $\varphi|_{f}^{\minus{1}}(\mathbf{x})=(\mathbf{x},f(\mathbf{x})$.
            This projection then shows that the graph of $f$ is homeomorphic to
            $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ itself. If we were to replace $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with
            and open subset $\mathcal{U}\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{n}$, the claim
            would still hold.
        \end{example}
        \begin{example}
            The most common non-trivial example of a topological manifold is
            the sphere $S^{n}$. This is the subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ such that
            $\norm{\mathbf{x}}_{2}=1$, where $\norm{\cdot}_{2}$ is the Euclidean
            norm defined by the Pythagorean formula. That $S^{n}$ is a
            topological manifold can be realized in two ways. The first is
            called the \textit{orthographic projection}. We take an observer
            standing on the north pole and then then them off to infinity along
            the line through the origin and the north pole. From the observers
            new perspective, only the top half of the sphere is visible. That
            is, this projection \textit{at infinity} is the set:
            \begin{equation}
                \mathcal{U}_{n-1}^{+}=\big\{\mathbf{x}\in{S}^{2}\;|\;x_{n-1}>0\}
            \end{equation}
            where $x_{n-1}$ is the last coordinate (the coordinate that
            corresponds to the north pole). For $S^{1}$ this is just the set:
            \begin{equation}
                \mathcal{U}_{y}^{+}=
                    \{\,(x,\sqrt{1-x^{2}})\in{S}^{2}\;|\;x\in[-1,1])\,\}
            \end{equation}
            and for $S^{2}$ this is:
            \begin{equation}
                \mathcal{U}_{z}^{+}=
                    \{\,(x,y,\sqrt{1-x^{2}-y^{2}})\in{S}^{2}\;
                    |\;x^{2}+y^{2}\leq{1}\,\}
            \end{equation}
            Since we only see the top half, this does not cover the entire
            sphere. Moreover it contains the boundary, and is therefore not
            open. To meet the requirements of a chart we must therefore remove
            the equator from this projection. Thus, if we with to cover the
            entire sphere with such sets we need $2(n+1)$ charts. That these
            charts are homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ can be seen by simply
            using the projection map
            $\pi^{i}:\mathbb{R}^{n+1}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n}$ which maps:
            \begin{equation}
                \pi^{i}(x_{0},x_{1},\dots,x_{j-1},x_{j},x_{j+1},\dots,x_{n-1})
                =(x_{0},x_{1},\dots,x_{j-1},x_{j+1},\dots,x_{n-1})
            \end{equation}
            This is continuous, and thus it's restriction to $S^{n}$ is
            continuous. Moreover, it's restriction is an open mapping, and hence
            the sets $\textrm{Int}(\mathcal{U}_{i}^{\pm})$ together with
            $\pi^{i}$ form charts.
        \end{example}
        \begin{example}
            The second, perhaps easier but less intuitive, method of showing
            that $S^{n}$ is a manifold is using \textit{stereographic}
            projection. Before, we lifted our observer to infinity and then
            projected the sphere from this point of view. Now, we keep the
            observer at the north pole and imagine what they'd see if the sphere
            was transparent. Drawing a line from the observer to another point
            on the sphere will then intersect the hyperplane $x_{0}=0$ once.
            We can use this to describe a chart that covers almost the entirety
            of $S^{n}$. Note the line from the North pole to itself will be
            parallel to the plane, and hence will never intersect. We define
            the stereographic projection function
            $\varphi:S^{n}\setminus\{(0,0,\dots,0,1)\}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n}$
            as follows:
            \begin{equation}
                \varphi(\mathbf{x})=\frac{\mathbf{x}}{1-x_{n-1}}
            \end{equation}
            Since a point is closed in a Hausdorff space, the set $S^{n}$ minus
            the north pole is open. Hence this open set is homeomorphic to
            $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and covers all but one point of the sphere. The
            mapping $\varphi$ is a homemorphism since its inverse is continuous:
            \begin{equation}
                \varphi^{\minus{1}}(\mathbf{X})=\Big(
                    \frac{2X_{0}}{1+\norm{\mathbf{X}}^{2}},\dots,
                    \frac{2X_{n-2}}{1+\norm{\mathbf{X}}^{2}},
                    \frac{1-\norm{\mathbf{X}}^{2}}{1+\norm{\mathbf{X}}^{2}}\Big)
            \end{equation}
            To make $S^{n}$ a topological manifold of dimension $n$ we need only
            add one more stereographic projection about any other point. The
            south pole is usually the most fitting choice, and so we have that
            $S^{n}$ is a manifold that can be covered with two charts.
        \end{example}
        This may naturally lead one to ask the question
        \textit{what's the minimum number of charts needed to cover a manifold?}
        Ostrand's theorem from topology tells us the answer is $n+1$. If the
        space is oriented and 2 dimensional, Morse theory can be used to reduce
        that to 1 or 2 (The only case where 1 is occurs is if the space is
        homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^{2}$).
        \par\hfill\par
        The next example to discuss are the real projective spaces, commonly
        denoted $\mathbb{RP}^{n}$.
        \begin{example}
            There are three common and equivalent ways to think of
            $\mathbb{RP}^{2}$, the real projective plane. Much the way the
            torus and the Klein bottle can be realized by and equivalence
            relation on the unit square, so can the real projective plane. The
            more common method is to consider the sphere $S^{2}$ and the
            following equivalence relation: $\mathbf{x}R\mathbf{y}$ if and only
            if $\mathbf{y}=\pm\minus\mathbf{x}$. The quotient space
            $S^{2}/R$ is then the real projective plane. Such pairing of
            antipodal points generalizes to all $n$ and so we may discuss the
            more general real projective space $\mathbb{RP}^{n}$. The last
            method is by considering the set of all lines through the origin.
            We can develop a projection map $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}\setminus\{0\}$
            into $\mathbb{RP}^{n}$ be sending $\mathbf{x}$ to the line it spans.
            That is, $\mathbf{x}\mapsto{t}\mathbf{x}$, where $t$ is a real
            variable. This mapping is indeed a projection mapping and thus we
            can endow $\mathbb{RP}^{n}$ with the quotient topology. For all
            $i\in\mathbb{Z}_{n+1}$, let $\mathcal{U}_{i}$ be the subset of
            $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ where $x_{i}\ne{0}$. Since lines are closed in
            $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, the complement is open and hence
            $\mathcal{U}_{i}$ is open. Moreover, it is saturated with respect to
            the quotient map:
            \begin{equation}
                \pi^{\minus{1}}\big(\pi(\mathcal{U}_{i})\big)=\mathcal{U}_{i}
            \end{equation}
            and hence the restriction of $\pi$ to $\mathcal{U}_{i}$ is again a
            quotient map. Let
            $\mathcal{V}_{i}=\pi|_{\mathcal{U}_{i}}(\mathcal{U}_{i})$ and define
            $\varphi:\mathcal{V}_{i}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n}$ by:
            \begin{equation}
                \varphi_{i}\big([\mathbf{x}]\big)=
                    \frac{\pi^{i}(\mathbf{x})}{x_{i}}
            \end{equation}
            This mapping is well define, for if $\mathbf{y}\in[\mathbf{x}]$ then
            there is a non-zero $t\in\mathbb{R}$ such that
            $\mathbf{y}=t\mathbf{x}$. But then:
            \begin{equation}
                \varphi\big([\mathbf{y}]\big)=
                    \frac{\pi^{i}(t\mathbf{x})}{tx_{i}}
                    =\frac{t\pi^{i}(\mathbf{x})}{tx_{i}}
                    =\frac{\pi^{i}(\mathbf{x})}{x_{i}}
                    =\varphi\big([\mathbf{x}]\big)
            \end{equation}
            Morevoer, since $x_{i}$ is non-zero for all
            $\mathbf{x}\in\mathcal{U}_{i}$, we are not dividing by zero.
            But $\varphi_{i}\circ\pi$ is continuous, and thus $\varphi_{i}$ is
            continuous (because $\pi$ is a quotient mapping). Moreover, it is a
            homeomorphism since it's inverse:
            \begin{equation}
                \varphi_{i}^{\minus{1}}(\mathbf{x})=
                    [x_{1},\dots,x_{i-1},1,x_{i},\dots,x_{n}]
            \end{equation}
            is continuous. Hence, $\mathbb{RP}^{n}$ is locally Euclidean.
        \end{example}
        \begin{theorem}
            $\mathbb{RP}^{n}$ is Hausdorff.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            For let $[\mathbf{x}]$ and $[\mathbf{y}]$ be distinct elements of
            $\mathbb{RP}^{n}$. For the case of $n>2$ there must be a
            $\mathcal{U}_{i}$ such that $\pi(\mathcal{U}_{i})$ contains both
            points. Since $\pi(\mathcal{U}_{i})$ is locally Euclidean, it is
            Hausdorff, and therefore $[\mathbf{x}]$ and $[\mathbf{y}]$ can be
            separated by open subsets of $\pi()\mathcal{U}_{i})$. For the case
            of $n=2$, the only scenario where $[\mathbf{x}]$ and $[\mathbf{y}]$
            do not lie in the same $\mathcal{U}_{i}$ for some $i$ is where
            $[\mathbf{x}]=[(1,0)]$ and $[\mathbf{y}]=[(0,1)]$. In this case,
            let $\mathcal{U}$ be the complement of the line spanned by
            $(1,1)$. Then $\pi(\mathcal{U})$ contains both $[\mathbf{x}]$ and
            $[\mathbf{y}]$, and by the preceeding arguments will be locally
            Euclidean. Being locally Euclidean, these two points can be
            separated by disjoint open sets. Thus, $\mathbb{RP}^{n}$ is
            Hausdorff.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
            $\mathbb{RP}^{n}$ is second countable.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            We have shown that $\mathbb{RP}^{n}$ can be covered by finitely many
            open subsets each of which is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^{n}$.
            But $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is second countable, and second countability is
            preserved by homeomorphisms and hence each of these open subsets is
            second countable. But then $\mathbb{RP}^{n}$ is the finite unione of
            second countable open subspaces, and is hence second countable.
        \end{proof}
        The open subspace part is crucial. One might think that if one has a
        countable collection of subspaces that cover the space, each of which
        being second countable, then the whole space is second countable, but
        this is not true. For example, consider the \textit{infinite bouquet}.
        Take $\mathbb{R}$ with the equivalence relation $R$ defined by
        $xRy$ if and only if $x=y$ or $x$ and $y$ are integers. The quotient
        space collaps all of $\mathbb{Z}$ down to a point, and the result looks
        like infinitely many rings connected at the origin. The point
        $[\mathbb{Z}]$ has no neighborhood that has a countable basis. Thus not
        only is this space not second countable, it's not even first countable
        (but it is separable).
        \begin{theorem}
            $\mathbb{RP}^{n}$ is compact.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            For the restriction $\pi_{S^{n}}:S^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{RP}^{n}$
            is surjective. Given $[\mathbf{x}]\in\mathbb{RP}^{n}$, let
            $\mathbf{y}=\mathbf{x}/\norm{\mathbf{x}}_{2}$. Then
            $\mathbf{y}\in{S}^{n}$ and $\pi(\mathbf{y})=[\mathbf{x}]$. Thus
            $\pi|_{S^{n}}$ is a continuous surjective map. But $S^{n}$ is
            compact by the Heine-Borel theorem, and thus the image of
            $S^{n}$ under $\pi|_{S^{n}}$ is compact. Therefore,
            $\mathbb{RP}^{n}$ is compact.
        \end{proof}
    \section{Notes from O'Neill}
        A smooth function $f:\mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{m}$ is one
        such that $\pi_{k}\circ{f}:\mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is
        smooth for all $k\in\mathbb{Z}_{m}$. A chart $(\mathcal{U},\varphi)$ in
        a topological space $(X,\tau)$ is an open set $\mathcal{U}\subseteq{X}$
        and an injective continuous open mapping
        $\varphi:\mathcal{U}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n}$. The coordinate functions
        of the chart $(\mathcal{U},\varphi)$ are the functions
        $x^{k}:\mathcal{U}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ defined by
        $x^{k}=\pi_{k}\circ\varphi$ for all $k\in\mathbb{Z}_{n}$. Smoothly
        overlapping charts are charts $(\mathcal{U},\varphi)$ and
        $(\mathcal{V},\psi)$ such that either
        $\mathcal{U}\cap\mathcal{V}=\emptyset$ or both
        $\varphi\circ\psi^{\minus{1}}$ and $\psi\circ\varphi^{\minus{1}}$ are
        smooth functions (in the Euclidean sense). The domain of
        $\varphi\circ\psi^{\minus{1}}$ is $\psi(\mathcal{V})$, which is an open
        subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, and hence this composition is a function
        from an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ to $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and thus
        asking if it is smooth is a valid well defined question. Similarly for
        $\psi\circ\varphi^{\minus{1}}$. A smooth atlas is a collection of charts
        $(\mathcal{U}_{\alpha},\varphi_{\alpha})$ such that the
        $\mathcal{U}_{\alpha}$ cover $X$ and each chart overlaps smoothly. A
        maximal smooth atlas is a smooth atlas $\mathcal{A}$ on $(X,\tau)$ such
        that for all smooth atlases $\mathcal{A}'$ such that
        $\mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathcal{A}'$ it is true that
        $\mathcal{A}=\mathcal{A}'$.
        \begin{theorem}
            If $(X,\tau)$ is a topological space, if $\mathcal{A}$ and
            $\mathcal{A}'$ are smooth atlases on $(X,\tau)$, then they are
            compatible if and only if $\mathcal{A}\cup\mathcal{A}'$ is a smooth
            atlas on $(X,\tau)$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            If they are compatible, then every chart in $\mathcal{A}$ overlaps
            smoothly with every chart in $\mathcal{A}'$, and vice versa. But
            $\mathcal{A}$ is a smooth atlas and thus every chart in
            $\mathcal{A}$ overlaps smoothly with every other chart in
            $\mathcal{A}$. Thus, every chart in $\mathcal{A}$ overlaps smoothly
            with every chart in $\mathcal{A}\cup\mathcal{A}'$, and similarly for
            $\mathcal{A}'$. Hence if $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{A}'$ are
            compatible, then $\mathcal{A}\cup\mathcal{A}'$ is a smooth atlas.
            Moreover, if $\mathcal{A}\cup\mathcal{A}'$ is a smooth atlas, then
            every element of $\mathcal{A}\cup\mathcal{A}'$ overlaps smoothly
            with every other element of $\mathcal{A}\cup\mathcal{A}'$. In
            particular, every element of $\mathcal{A}$ overlaps smoothly with
            every element of $\mathcal{A}'$, and vice-versa. Hence,
            $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{A}'$ are compatible.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
            If $\mathcal{A}$ is a smooth atlas on $(X,\tau)$, then there is a
            unique maximal smooth atlas $\mathcal{C}$ such that
            $\mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathcal{C}$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            The set of all atlases on $(X,\tau)$ forms a partially ordered set
            by inclusion. Given any chain of atlases, by the previous theorem
            the union is then again an atlas compatible with all atlases in the
            chain. That is, every chain has an upper bound. Hence by Zorn's
            lemma every Atlas has a maximal atlas. If there is another maximal
            atlas, the union will again be a smooth atlas, contradicting
            maximality, and hence there is a unique maximal smooth atlas.
        \end{proof}
        A smooth manifold is a second countable Hausdorff topological space with
        a maximal smooth atlas.
        \begin{theorem}
            If $(X,\tau,\mathcal{A})$ is a smooth manifold, if
            $(\mathcal{U},\varphi)\in\mathcal{A}$, and if $\mathcal{V}$ is an
            open subset such that $\mathcal{U}\cap\mathcal{V}\ne\emptyset$, then
            $(\mathcal{U}\cap\mathcal{V},%
             \varphi|_{\mathcal{U}\cap\mathcal{V}})\in\mathcal{A}$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            For since $\mathcal{U}$ and $\mathcal{V}$ are open,
            $\mathcal{U}\cap\mathcal{V}$ is open. But then
            $\varphi|_{\mathcal{U}\cap\mathcal{V}}$ is a continuous and
            injective open mapping. If $(\mathcal{O},\psi)\in\mathcal{A}$, then
            it overlaps smoothly with $(\mathcal{U},\varphi)$. But smoothness
            is a local property, and hence it overlaps smoothly with
            $(\mathcal{U}\cap\mathcal{V},\varphi|_{\mathcal{U}\cap\mathcal{V}})$
            and since $\mathcal{A}$ is maximal, it contains this chart.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
            If $(X,\tau,\mathcal{A})$ is a smooth manifold and $A\subseteq{X}$,
            then $(A,\tau|_{A},\mathcal{A}|_{A})$ is a smooth manifold where
            $\tau|_{A}$ is the subspace topology and:
            \begin{equation}
                \mathcal{A}|_{A}=
                \{\,(\mathcal{U},\varphi)\in\mathcal{A}\;|\;\,
                    \mathcal{U}\subseteq{A}\,\}
            \end{equation}
