        \begin{definition}
            An $n$ dimensional smooth manifold is a topological space $(M,\tau)$
            equipped with a collection $\mathcal{A}$ or ordered pairs
            $\{(\mathcal{U}_{\alpha},\varphi_{\alpha})\}$ such that
            $\mathcal{U}_{\alpha}$ are open and cover the space, and such that
            $\varphi_{\alpha}:\mathcal{U}_{\alpha}\rightarrow\mathcal{V}_{\alpha}$
            is a homeomorphism to an open subset $\mathcal{V}_{\alpha}$ of
            $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and such that for when
            $\mathcal{U}_{\alpha}\cap\mathcal{U}_{\beta}\ne\emptyset$, the
            functions $\varphi_{\beta}\circ\varphi_{\alpha}^{\minus{1}}$
            are smooth.
        \end{definition}
        The notion of smoothness here is simply the smoothness of functions
        from $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ to itself. The collection $\mathcal{A}$ is called
        an atlas and $(\mathcal{U},\varphi)$ are called charts.
        \begin{example}
            If $\mathcal{U}$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and
            $f:\mathcal{U}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is smooth, then the
            graph of $f$ is a smooth manifold.
        \end{example}
        \begin{example}
            If $\mathcal{U}\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is open, if
            $f:\mathcal{U}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is smooth, if $c$ is in the
            range of $f$, and if $\textrm{grad}(f)$ is non-zero on all of
            $f^{\minus{1}}(c)$, then $f^{\minus{1}}(c)$ is a smooth manifold.
        \end{example}
        \begin{example}
            Define $f:\mathbb{R}^{3}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ by
            $f(\mathbf{x})=\norm{\mathbf{x}}_{2}^{2}$. For all
            $\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^{3}$ such that $\norm{\mathbf{x}}=1$ we
            have $\textrm{grad}(f)\ne{0}$, and thus $f^{\minus{1}}(\{1\})$ is a
            smooth manifold. This is the unit sphere.
        \end{example}
        \begin{example}
            The orthographic projection of the sphere maps:
            \begin{equation}
                (x,y)\mapsto(x,y,\sqrt{1-x^{2}-y^{2}})
            \end{equation}
            The stereographic projection also exists.
        \end{example}
        \begin{definition}
            The product manifold of manifolds $M_{1},\hdots,M_{k}$, where
            $M_{j}$ is an $n_{j}$ smooth manifold then
            $M=\prod_{j=1}^{k}M_{j}$ has a natural structure of an
            $n=n_{1}+\dots+n_{k}$ dimensional manifold.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{definition}
            The quotient manifold of a smooth manifold $M$ with an equivalence
            relation $\sim$ is a manifold structure on $M/\sim$ with the
            quotient topology. In particular when we have group actions.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{example}
            Consider the sphere $S^{2}$ with the equivalence relation $R$
            defined by $pRq$ if and only if $p=\pm{q}$. The quotient space
            $S^{2}/R$ is the real projective plane $\mathbb{RP}^{2}$. We can
            consider this by means of a group action on $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ on
            $S^{2}$. Define $g\cdot{p}$ by $1\cdot{p}=p$ and
            $\minus{1}\cdot{p}=\minus{p}$. This is a group action of
            $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ on $S^{2}$.
        \end{example}
        All of the examples thus far have been subsets of some Euclidean space
        $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. One natural question is whether or not there are
        smooth manifolds that do no live in some higher dimensional Euclidean
        space. That is, are there manifolds $M$ such that $M$ can not be
        embedded into some $\mathbb{R}^{m}$?
        \begin{definition}
            A function $\phi:M\rightarrow{N}$ is smooth if for all $p\in{M}$
            there is a chart $(\mathcal{U},\varphi)$ containing $p$ and a
            chart $(\mathcal{V},\psi)$ containing $\phi(p)$ such that
            $\psi\circ\phi\circ\varphi^{\minus{1}}$ is smooth.
        \end{definition}
        Studying maps between manifolds gives us new manifolds to study. In
        particular, there are submersions and embeddings, and in particular
        embedded submanifolds.
        \par\hfill\par
        Tangent spaces are another important topic in differential topology. The
        classic example is that of a sphere $S^{2}$ in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$. We draw
        the tangent plane to a point on a sphere, which is the best linear
        approximation of the sphere at that point. This notion relies on an
        ambient space (that of $\mathbb{R}^{3}$), but since we do not yet know
        if all manifolds can be embedded into such an ambient space, we need a
        new means of defining tangent spaces that agrees with our intuition.
        There are several ways of thinking of this:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Tangent vectors are derivations on $C^{\infty}(p)$.
            \item Tangent vectors are equivalence classes of curves through $p$.
        \end{itemize}
        Given a function $\phi:M\rightarrow{N}$ that is smooth between two
        manifolds, there is a function $\diff\phi_{o}:T_{p}M\rightarrow{T}_{p}N$
        between these tangent spaces. We can further consider the collection of
        all tangent spaces at all points $p$ of $M$, forming the tangent bundle
        of $M$, denoted $TM$. Set theoretically, this is the disjoint union
        $TM=\coprod_{p}T_{p}M$, but we do \textbf{not} give this the disjoint
        union topology. There is a natural topology that can be endowed on $TM$.
        \begin{example}
            If we take $S^{1}$, the tangent bundle is
            $TM=S^{1}\times\mathbb{R}$. This is an example of a trivial bundle.
            Most tangent bundles are not of this form. That is, for an $m$
            dimensional manifold $M$, $TM$ is usual \textbf{not} equal to
            $M\times\mathbb{R}^{m}$. It will, however, always have dimension
            $2m$.
        \end{example}
