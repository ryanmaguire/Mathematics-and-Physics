        \begin{problem}
            Prove that if $M_{1},\dots,M_{k}$ are smooth manifolds with or
            without boundary such that at most one of them has non-empty
            boundary, if $\mathcal{M}$ is the product manifold, if $\pi_{i}$
            is the $i^{th}$ projection mapping, then $F:N\rightarrow\mathcal{M}$
            is smooth if and only if $\pi_{i}\circ{F}$ is smooth for all
            $i\in\mathbb{Z}_{k}$.
        \end{problem}
        \begin{solution}
            First we show that $\pi_{i}$ is smooth. Let
            $\mathcal{M}=M_{1}\times{M}_{2}$ and let $\pi_{1}$ be the projection
            map $(p,q)\mapsto{p}$. Let $(p,q)\in\mathcal{M}$. Since
            $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ are manifolds, there are charts
            $(\mathcal{U}_{1},\varphi_{1})$ and $(\mathcal{U}_{2},\varphi_{2})$
            such that $p\in\mathcal{U}_{1}$ and $q\in\mathcal{U}_{2}$ but by the
            definition of the product manifold,
            $\mathcal{U}_{1}\times\mathcal{U}_{2}$ is open in $\mathcal{M}$ and
            $(p,q)\in\mathcal{U}_{1}\times\mathcal{U}_{2}$. Moreover, the
            product function $\varphi_{1}\times\varphi_{2}$ is smooth. But then
            for all $(x,y)\in\mathcal{U}_{1}\times\mathcal{U}_{2}$ we have:
            \begin{align}
                \varphi_{1}\circ\pi_{1}\circ
                    (\varphi_{1}\times\varphi_{2})^{\minus{1}}(x,y)
                &=\varphi_{1}\circ\big(
                    \pi_{1}\circ(\varphi_{1}\times\varphi_{2})^{\minus{1}}(x,y)
                \big)\\
                &=\varphi_{1}\circ\Big(
                    \pi_{1}\big(\varphi_{1}^{\minus{1}}(x),
                                \varphi_{2}^{\minus{1}}(y)\big)\Big)\\
                &=\varphi_{1}\circ\big(\varphi_{1}^{\minus{1}}(x)\big)\\
                &=x
            \end{align}
            And thus we have the projection map from $\mathbb{R}^{d_{1}+d_{1}}$
            to $\mathbb{R}^{d_{1}}$, which is smooth. Hence for all
            $(p,q)\in\mathcal{M}$ there is a chart $(\mathcal{U},\varphi)$
            containing $(p,q)$ and a chart $(\mathcal{V},\psi)$ containg
            $\pi_{1}(p,q)$ such that $\psi\circ\pi_{1}\circ\varphi^{\minus{1}}$
            is smooth, and thus $\pi_{1}$ is smooth. Similarly, $\pi_{2}$ is
            smooth. For the general case we proceed by induction and write:
            \begin{equation}
                \mathcal{M}=\prod_{k=1}^{n+1}M_{k}=
                    \Big(\prod_{k=1}^{n}M_{k}\Big)\times{M}_{n+1}
                \equiv\widehat{\mathcal{M}}\times{M}_{n+1}
            \end{equation}
            which is the product of two manifolds, one of dimension
            $d_{1}+d_{2}+\dots+d_{n}$ and the other of dimension $d_{n+1}$, and
            thus by the previous argument the projection maps are smooth. Hence,
            $\pi_{n+1}$ is smooth. But by the induction hypothesis, all of the
            $\pi_{i}$ are smooth of $i=1,\dots,n$, and thus all $\pi_{i}$ are
            smooth. Now, suppose $f:N\rightarrow\mathcal{M}$ is smooth. Then
            $F_{i}=\pi_{i}\circ{F}$ is the composition of smooth function and
            hence by theorem 2.10 (d) in Lee's text, $F_{i}$ is smooth. In the
            other direction, we again start with the case that
            $\mathcal{M}=M_{1}\times{M}_{2}$. Suppose
            $F:N\rightarrow\mathcal{M}$ is such that $\pi_{1}\circ{F}$ and
            $\pi_{2}\circ{F}$ are smooth. Let $v\in{N}$ and let
            $(\mathcal{V},\psi)$ be a chart containing $v$ and let
            $(\widehat{\mathcal{U}},\widehat{\varphi})$ be a chart containing
            $F(v)$. Let $\mathcal{U}_{i}=\pi_{i}[\widehat{\mathcal{U}}]$ and
            let $\varphi_{i}=\pi_{i}\circ\widehat{\varphi}$. Then the
            $\varphi_{i}$ are the composition of smooth functions, and hence are
            smooth, and the $\mathcal{U}_{i}$ are the projections of an open set
            and are hence open. Moreover,
            $(\mathcal{U}_{1}\times\mathcal{U}_{2},%
             \varphi_{1}\times\varphi_{2})$ is a chart containing $F(v)$.
        \end{solution}
