    \begin{problem}
        Show that $\mathbb{RP}^{n}$ is Hausdorff and second countable.
    \end{problem}
    \begin{solution}
        $\mathbb{RP}^{n}$ can be seen as the quotient space of $S^{n}$ under the
        continuous action of $\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\times}$ on $S^{n}$ defined by
        $1\cdot\vector{x}=\vector{x}$ and
        $\minus{1}\cdot\vector{x}=\minus\vector{x}$. Since
        $\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\times}$ is a compact topological group (it's finite),
        and since $S^{n}$ is Hausdorff and second countable (since it's a
        subspace of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$), then $S^{n}/\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\times}$ is
        Hausdorff and second countable.
        \par\hfill\par
        Alternatively, Let $[\mathbf{x}]$ and $[\mathbf{y}]$ be distinct
        elements in the quotient space $\mathbb{RP}^{n}$. Let $\varepsilon$ be
        defined by:
        \begin{equation}
            \varepsilon=\frac{1}{4}\cos^{\minus{1}}\Big(
                \frac{\langle\vector{x}|\vector{y}\rangle}
                     {\norm{\vector{x}}\norm{\vector{y}}}
            \Big)
        \end{equation}
        Consider the open cones $\Lambda_{1}$ and $\Lambda_{2}$ about
        the lines passing thought $\vector{x}$ and the origin, and $\vector{y}$
        and the origin, respectively, such that each line in $\Lambda_{1}$ has
        an angle of less than $\varepsilon$ with the line containing
        the origin and $\vector{x}$, and similarly for $\vector{y}$ and
        $\Lambda_{2}$. From the definition of $\varepsilon$, these cones
        intersect only at the origin. Hence, in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}\setminus\{0\}$
        they are disjoint. Moreover, they are saturated, i.e.
        $\pi^{\minus{1}}\big(\pi(\Lambda_{i})\big)=\Lambda_{i}$. Thus the
        forward image is an open subset in the quotient space. But
        $\pi(\Lambda_{1})$ contains $[\vector{x}]$ and $\pi(\Lambda_{2})$
        contains $[\vector{y}]$, and moreover these projections are disjoint.
        Thus $[\vector{x}]$ and $[\vector{y}]$ can be separeted by open
        disjoint sets, and hence $\mathbb{RP}^{n}$ is Hausdorff.
        \par\hfill\par
        One final way, using the open sets $\mathcal{U}_{i}$ constructed in
        Lee's text, if $n>2$, then for any $[\vector{x}]$ and $[\vector{y}]$
        there is a $\mathcal{U}_{i}$ containing both of these points. Since the
        $\mathcal{U}_{i}$ are homeomorphic to an open subset of Euclidean space,
        they are Hausdorff, and hence $[\vector{x}]$ and $[\vector{y}]$ can be
        separeted by disjoint open sets. For the case of $n=2$ the only problem
        we run in to is when $[\vector{x}]$ represents the $x$ axis and
        $[\vector{y}]$ represents the $y$ axis since $[\vector{x}]$ does not lie
        in $\mathcal{U}_{x}$ and $[\vector{y}]$ is not contained in
        $\mathcal{U}_{y}$. Thus there is no $\mathcal{U}_{i}$ in this
        construction that contains both $[\vector{x}]$ and $[\vector{y}]$. Form
        a new set $\tilde{\mathcal{U}}$ defined by the complement of the line
        $y=x$. By identical arguments the projection $\mathcal{U}$ will be
        homeomorphic to an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^{2}$, however this set
        will contain $[\vector{x}]$ and $[\vector{y}]$, and hence all distinct
        points can be separeted. Thus, $\mathbb{RP}^{2}$ is Hausdorff.
        \par\hfill\par
        For second countability, we've shown that $\mathbb{RP}^{n}$ can be
        covered by $n+1$ open subset $\mathcal{U}_{i}$, each of which is
        homeomorphic to an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Thus each
        $\mathcal{U}_{i}$ is second countable, since second countability is
        preserved by homeomorphisms. Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the union of these
        $n+1$ bases. Let $\mathcal{V}$ be an open subset of $\mathbb{RP}^{n}$.
        Since $\mathcal{V}$ and each $\mathcal{U}_{i}$ is open,
        $\mathcal{V}\cap\mathcal{U}_{i}$ is open. But this intersection is a
        subset of $\mathcal{U}_{i}$, and hence there is a subset
        $\Delta_{i}\subseteq\mathcal{B}$ such that:
        \begin{equation}
            \mathcal{V}\cap\mathcal{U}_{i}=
                \bigcup_{\mathcal{O}\in\Delta}\mathcal{O}
        \end{equation}
        But then:
        \begin{equation}
            \mathcal{V}=
            \bigcup_{i\in\mathbb{Z}_{n+1}}\big(
                \mathcal{V}\cap\mathcal{U}_{i}
            \big)
            =\bigcup_{i\in\mathbb{Z}_{n+1}}\Big(
                \bigcup_{\mathcal{O}\in\Delta_{i}}\mathcal{O}\Big)
        \end{equation}
        Thus every open subset can be written as the union of elements of
        $\mathcal{B}$. Since $\mathcal{B}$ is the finite union of countable
        sets, it is therefore countable. Hence, $\mathcal{B}$ is a countable
        basis.
    \end{solution}
