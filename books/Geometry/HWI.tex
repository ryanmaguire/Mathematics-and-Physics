    \section{Preliminary Stuff}
        The following were presented as exercises in the appendix of Lee's
        textbook and can justify the use of sequences without invoking more
        complicated results pertaining to metrizability.
        \begin{definition}
            A sequentially continuous function from a topological space
            $(X,\tau_{X})$ to a topological space $(Y,\tau_{Y})$ is a
            function $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ such that for every convergent sequence
            $a:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow{X}$, it is true that:
            \begin{equation*}
                \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}f(a_{n})
                =f(\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}a_{n})
            \end{equation*}
        \end{definition}
        \begin{definition}
            A sequential topological space is a topological space $(X,\tau)$
            such that for every topological space $(Y,\tau_{Y})$ and for every
            sequentially continuous function $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$, it is true
            that $f$ is continuous.
        \end{definition}
        Continuity implies sequential continuity, the converse need not always
        hold. If $(X,\tau)$ is first countable, the result is true.
        \begin{theorem}
            If $(X,\tau)$ is a first countable topological space, if
            $\mathcal{U}\subseteq{X}$, then $\mathcal{U}$ is open if and only if
            for every sequence $a:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow{X}$ such that there is
            an $x\in\mathcal{U}$ such that $a_{n}\rightarrow{x}$, then there
            exists an $N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that for all $n>N$, it is true that
            $a_{n}\in\mathcal{U}$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            One direction is the definition of convergence. In the other, since
            $(X,\tau)$ is first countable, for all $x\in\mathcal{U}$ there is a
            countable neighborhood basis $\mathcal{B}_{x}$. Let
            $\mathcal{V}_{x}:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathcal{B}_{x}$ be a
            bijection. Then there exists an $N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that
            $\mathcal{V}_{x,N}\subseteq\mathcal{U}$. For suppose not. Let
            $B_{n}$ be defined by:
            \begin{equation}
                B_{n}=\bigcap_{k\in\mathbb{Z}_{n}}\mathcal{V}_{x,k}
            \end{equation}
            Since $B_{n}$ is the intersection of finitely many open sets, it is
            open. Moreover it is non-empty since $x\in{B}_{n}$ for all $n$.
            But then $B_{n}$ is an open neighborhood about $x$, and since
            $\mathcal{B}_{x}$ is a neighborhood basis there is an element
            $\mathcal{V}_{x,N}$ such that $\mathcal{V}_{x,N}\subseteq{B}_{n}$.
            But by hypothesis, for any such set there is a
            $y_{n}\in\mathcal{V}_{x,N}$ such that $y_{n}\notin\mathcal{U}$.
            Thus, for all $n$ there is a $y_{n}\in{B}_{n}$ such that
            $y_{n}\notin\mathcal{U}$. Then $y_{n}\rightarrow{x}$ since for any
            open subset about $x$ there is an $N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that
            $\mathcal{V}_{x,N}$ sits inside this open set. But for all $n>N$,
            $y_{n}\in\mathcal{V}_{x,N}$. Thus $y_{n}$ is a sequence that
            converges to $x$, but is never contained inside $\mathcal{U}$,
            a contradiction. Thus, for all $x\in\mathcal{U}$ there is an open
            subset $\mathcal{V}_{x,N}$ such that $x\in\mathcal{V}_{x,N}$ and
            $\mathcal{V}_{x,N}\subseteq\mathcal{U}$. But then $\mathcal{U}$ is
            simply the union over all of these open sets, and is thus open.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
            If $(X,\tau)$ is a first countable topological space, then it is
            a sequential space.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            For let $(Y,\tau_{Y})$ be a topological space, and let
            $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ be a sequentially continuous function. Let
            $\mathcal{V}\in\tau_{Y}$ be an open subset of $Y$. If
            $f^{\minus{1}}[\mathcal{V}]=\emptyset$, we are done. If not, let
            $x\in{f}^{\minus{1}}[\mathcal{V}]$ and let
            $a:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow{X}$ be a sequence such that
            $a_{n}\rightarrow{x}$. But $f$ is sequentially continuous, and thus
            $f(a_{n})\rightarrow{f}(x)$. But since $\mathcal{V}$ is open, there
            is an $N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that for all $n>N$ it is true that
            $f(a_{n})\in\mathcal{V}$. But then for all $n>N$ it is true that
            $a_{n}\in{f}^{\minus{1}}[\mathcal{V}]$. Thus every sequence that
            converges to a point in $f^{\minus{1}}[\mathcal{V}]$ is eventually
            contained in $f^{\minus{1}}[\mathcal{V}]$, and thus by the
            previous theorem this set is open. Thus the pre-image of open is
            open, and hence $f$ is continuous.
        \end{proof}
    \section{Homework I: Part A}
    \begin{problem}
        Show that $\mathbb{RP}^{n}$ is Hausdorff and second countable.
    \end{problem}
    \begin{solution}
        $\mathbb{RP}^{n}$ can be seen as the quotient space of $S^{n}$ under the
        continuous action of $\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\times}$ on $S^{n}$ defined by
        $1\cdot\vector{x}=\vector{x}$ and
        $\minus{1}\cdot\vector{x}=\minus\vector{x}$. Since
        $\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\times}$ is a compact topological group (it's finite),
        and since $S^{n}$ is Hausdorff and second countable (since it's a
        subspace of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$), then $S^{n}/\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\times}$ is
        Hausdorff and second countable.
        \par\hfill\par
        Alternatively, Let $[\mathbf{x}]$ and $[\mathbf{y}]$ be distinct
        elements in the quotient space $\mathbb{RP}^{n}$. Let $\varepsilon$ be
        defined by:
        \begin{equation}
            \varepsilon=\frac{1}{4}\cos^{\minus{1}}\Big(
                \frac{\langle\vector{x}|\vector{y}\rangle}
                     {\norm{\vector{x}}\norm{\vector{y}}}
            \Big)
        \end{equation}
        Consider the open cones $\Lambda_{1}$ and $\Lambda_{2}$ about
        the lines passing thought $\vector{x}$ and the origin, and $\vector{y}$
        and the origin, respectively, such that each line in $\Lambda_{1}$ has
        an angle of less than $\varepsilon$ with the line containing
        the origin and $\vector{x}$, and similarly for $\vector{y}$ and
        $\Lambda_{2}$. From the definition of $\varepsilon$, these cones
        intersect only at the origin. Hence, in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}\setminus\{0\}$
        they are disjoint. Moreover, they are saturated, i.e.
        $\pi^{\minus{1}}\big(\pi(\Lambda_{i})\big)=\Lambda_{i}$. Thus the
        forward image is an open subset in the quotient space. But
        $\pi(\Lambda_{1})$ contains $[\vector{x}]$ and $\pi(\Lambda_{2})$
        contains $[\vector{y}]$, and moreover these projections are disjoint.
        Thus $[\vector{x}]$ and $[\vector{y}]$ can be separeted by open
        disjoint sets, and hence $\mathbb{RP}^{n}$ is Hausdorff.
        \par\hfill\par
        One final way, using the open sets $\mathcal{U}_{i}$ constructed in
        Lee's text, if $n>2$, then for any $[\vector{x}]$ and $[\vector{y}]$
        there is a $\mathcal{U}_{i}$ containing both of these points. Since the
        $\mathcal{U}_{i}$ are homeomorphic to an open subset of Euclidean space,
        they are Hausdorff, and hence $[\vector{x}]$ and $[\vector{y}]$ can be
        separeted by disjoint open sets. For the case of $n=2$ the only problem
        we run in to is when $[\vector{x}]$ represents the $x$ axis and
        $[\vector{y}]$ represents the $y$ axis since $[\vector{x}]$ does not lie
        in $\mathcal{U}_{x}$ and $[\vector{y}]$ is not contained in
        $\mathcal{U}_{y}$. Thus there is no $\mathcal{U}_{i}$ in this
        construction that contains both $[\vector{x}]$ and $[\vector{y}]$. Form
        a new set $\tilde{\mathcal{U}}$ defined by the complement of the line
        $y=x$. By identical arguments the projection $\mathcal{U}$ will be
        homeomorphic to an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^{2}$, however this set
        will contain $[\vector{x}]$ and $[\vector{y}]$, and hence all distinct
        points can be separeted. Thus, $\mathbb{RP}^{2}$ is Hausdorff.
        \par\hfill\par
        For second countability, we've shown that $\mathbb{RP}^{n}$ can be
        covered by $n+1$ open subset $\mathcal{U}_{i}$, each of which is
        homeomorphic to an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Thus each
        $\mathcal{U}_{i}$ is second countable, since second countability is
        preserved by homeomorphisms. Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the union of these
        $n+1$ bases. Let $\mathcal{V}$ be an open subset of $\mathbb{RP}^{n}$.
        Since $\mathcal{V}$ and each $\mathcal{U}_{i}$ is open,
        $\mathcal{V}\cap\mathcal{U}_{i}$ is open. But this intersection is a
        subset of $\mathcal{U}_{i}$, and hence there is a subset
        $\Delta_{i}\subseteq\mathcal{B}$ such that:
        \begin{equation}
            \mathcal{V}\cap\mathcal{U}_{i}=
                \bigcup_{\mathcal{O}\in\Delta}\mathcal{O}
        \end{equation}
        But then:
        \begin{equation}
            \mathcal{V}=
            \bigcup_{i\in\mathbb{Z}_{n+1}}\big(
                \mathcal{V}\cap\mathcal{U}_{i}
            \big)
            =\bigcup_{i\in\mathbb{Z}_{n+1}}\Big(
                \bigcup_{\mathcal{O}\in\Delta_{i}}\mathcal{O}\Big)
        \end{equation}
        Thus every open subset can be written as the union of elements of
        $\mathcal{B}$. Since $\mathcal{B}$ is the finite union of countable
        sets, it is therefore countable. Hence, $\mathcal{B}$ is a countable
        basis.
    \end{solution}
