# The Speed of Light
The idea that light travels at a finite speed is very old,
pre-dating Euclidean geometry by at least 100 years.
In the 1600's the Italian astronomy Galileo Galilei
proposed an experiment in which two observers standing
atop mountains that are a little over two kilometers apart would
open a lantern and try to determine the time delay between
uncovering the lantern and seeing the light.
Galileo admits he was unable to determine whether or not
light travels at a finite speed from this experiments,
but concedes that if it is finite, it must travel at
several orders of magnitude more than the speed of sound.

Galileo's experiment was doomed to fail. The speed of
light is so great that by the time it travels from
the lantern to the observer, the electrical signals
in the human nervous system have not yet traveled from the
observer's eye to their brain. The modern measurement of the
speed of light is 299,792,458 meters per second. The fastest
neurons in the human body send electochemical signals at
120 meters per second. In the time it takes light to travel
the 2 kilometers between the mountains the observers stood
on, these signals have only traveled 1 millimeter.
Galileo's conclusion that light must be orders of magnitude
greater than that of sound is correct: the ratio is nearly $10^{6}$.

While Galileo's methods failed to accurately determine the speed
of light, only a few decades later were physicists able to make
such measurements. The key lies in the planet Jupiter and its many
moons. In Isaac Newton's 1704 text *Optiks* he writes:

>*Mathematicians usually consider the Rays of Light to be Lines*
>*reaching from the luminous Body to the Body illuminated, and the*
>*refraction of those Rays to be the bending or breaking of those*
>*lines in their passing out of one Medium into another. And thus*
>*may Rays and Refractions be considered, if Light be propagated in*
>*an instant. But by an Argument taken from the Æquations of the times*
>*of the Eclipses of Jupiter’s Satellites, it seems that Light is*
>*propagated in time, spending in its passage from the Sun to us*
>*about seven Minutes of time: And therefore I have chosen to*
>*define Rays and Refractions in such general terms as may agree*
>*to Light in both cases.*
>
>*Isaac Newton,*
>*Optiks, 1704*

Newton is eluding to an argument made by Ole R&oslash;mer.
R&oslash;mer observes that, if Newton's theory of gravity is true,
then to explain discepencies in the period of Io around Jupiter, one
must conclude that the speed of light is finite. Using estimates of
the distance from the Earth to the Sun, and by measuring the difference
in the period to be about 22 minutes, we obtain a value of
220,000,000 meters per second. Not bad!

Better measurements did not take long.
In 1729 James Bradley used the concept of *stellar abberation*
to obtain a measurement that has an error of less than 2% from
the modern value.
