\section{Cardinality}
        Functions can also be called maps or mappings. The unique point
        $b\in{B}$ such that $(a,b)\in{f}$ is often called the image of
        $a$ under $f$. We sometimes write $a\mapsto{b}$, but most often
        will write $f(a)=b$.
        The image of a subset $A\subseteq{X}$ is the set of all points
        that get mapped onto by the function $f$ by the elements in $A$.
        In a similar manner we can define the opposite of this notion,
        called the pre-image.
        \begin{axiom}
            If $X$ is a non-empty set such that for all $x\in{X}$,
            $x\ne\emptyset$, then there is a function
            $f:X\rightarrow\bigcup_{x\in{X}}x$ such that,
            for all $x\in{X}$, $f(x)\in{x}$.
        \end{axiom}
        This is called the axiom of choice. It can be made into
        a blatantly obvious statement, by choosing a more careful
        wording, however many of the results it gives are far
        from intuitive. This says that, given a collection of sets,
        each of which is non-empty, one may choose a single element from
        each set. This choosing is the function $f$, and is often called
        a \textit{choice function}. For those interested, the axiom
        of choice is consistent with modern set theory (Called
        Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, or ZF). It may thus be rejected
        or accepted without logical contradiction.
        \begin{theorem}
            \label{theorem:Set_Theory_Image_of_Empty_Set_Is_Empty}
            If $A$ and $B$ are sets, and if $f:A\rightarrow{B}$
            is a function, then:
            \begin{equation}
                f(\emptyset)=\emptyset
            \end{equation}
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            For suppose not. Let $y\in{f}(\emptyset)$.
            But then there is an
            $x\in\emptyset$ such that $f(x)=y$, a contradiction
            ince for all $x$, $x\notin\emptyset$.
            Thus, $f(\emptyset)=\emptyset$.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
            If $A$ and $B$ are sets, and if $f:A\rightarrow{B}$ is a function, then:
            \begin{equation}
                f^{-1}(\emptyset)=\emptyset
            \end{equation}
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            For suppose not. Then there is an $x\in{X}$ such that
            $f(x)\in\emptyset$, a contradiction since for all $x$,
            $f(x)\notin\emptyset$. Therefore, etc.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
            If $X$ and $Y$ are sets, if $A\subseteq{X}$, and if
            $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ is a function such that
            $f(A)=\emptyset$, then $A=\emptyset$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            For suppose not. If $A\ne\emptyset$, then there is an
            $x\in{A}$. But then $f(x)\in{f}(A)$, a contradiction as
            $f(A)=\emptyset$. Therefore, etc.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
            If $X$ and $Y$ are sets, if $B$ is a subset of $Y$,
            and if $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ is a function, then:
            \begin{equation}
                f\big(f^{-1}(B)\big)\subseteq{B}
            \end{equation}
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            For if $y\in{f(f^{-1}(B))}$, then there is an
            $x\in{f^{-1}(B)}$ such that $y=f(x)$. But if
            $x\in{f^{-1}(B)}$, then $f(x)\in{B}$. Thus,
            $y\in{B}$. Therefore, etc.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
            If $X$ and $Y$ are non-empty sets and if there exists
            $y_{1},y_{2}\in{Y}$ such that $y_{1}\ne{y}_{2}$, then
            there is a function $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ and a
            $B\subseteq{Y}$ such that:
            \begin{equation}
                f\big(f^{-1}(B)\big)\ne{B}
            \end{equation}
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            \begin{subequations}
                For if $X$ and $Y$ are non-empty, let $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$
                be defined by:
                \begin{equation}
                    f=\{(x,y_{1}):x\in{X}\}
                \end{equation}
                Then $f$ is a function, since $f\subseteq{X}\times{Y}$
                as $y_{1}\in{Y}$. Moreover, for all $x\in{X}$ there is a
                unique $y\in{Y}$ such that $(x,y)\in{f}$. Thus, $f$ is a
                function from $X$ to $Y$. However since for all
                $x\in{X}$, $f(x)=y_{1}$, we have that:
                \begin{equation}
                    f^{-1}(\{y_{2}\})=\emptyset
                \end{equation}
                For suppose $x\in{f}^{-1}(\{y_{2}\})$.
                Then $f(x)=y_{2}$, but for all $x\in{X}$, $f(x)=y_{1}$,
                and $y_{1}\ne{y}_{2}$. Thus
                $f^{-1}(\{y_{2}\})=\emptyset$. But by
                Thm.~\ref{theorem:Set_Theory_Image_%
                          of_Empty_Set_Is_Empty},
                $f(\emptyset)=\emptyset$. Therefore:
                \begin{equation}
                    f\big(f^{-1}(\{y_{2}\})\big)=\emptyset
                \end{equation}
                But $\{y_{2}\}\ne\emptyset$ and
                $\{y_{2}\}\subseteq{Y}$. Therefore, etc.
            \end{subequations}
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
            If $X$ and $Y$ are sets, if $A$ is a subset of $X$,
            and if $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ is a function, then:
            \begin{equation}
                A\subseteq{f^{-1}}\big(f(A)\big)
            \end{equation}
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            For if $x\in{A}$, then there is a
            $y\in{f}(A)$ such that $f(x)=y$. But then
            $x\in{f^{-1}(f(A))}$. Therefore, etc.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
            If $X$ and $Y$ are sets, if $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$ are
            subsets of $X$ such that $A_{1}\subseteq{A}_{2}$,
            and if $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ is a function, then:
            \begin{equation}
                f(A_{1})\subseteq{f}(A_{2})
            \end{equation}
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            For if $y\in{f}(A_{1})$, then there is an $x\in{A}_{1}$
            such that $f(x)=y$. But $A_{1}\subseteq{A}_{2}$, and
            therefore $x\in{A}_{2}$. But if $x\in{A}_{2}$, then
            $f(x)\in{f}(A_{2})$. Thus, $y\in{f}(A_{2})$. Therefore, etc.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
            If $X$ and $Y$ are sets, if $B_{1}$ and $B_{2}$ are subsets of
            $Y$ such that $B_{1}\subseteq{B}_{2}$, and if $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$
            is a function, then:
            \begin{equation}
                f^{-1}(B_{1})\subseteq{f^{-1}}(B_{2})
            \end{equation}
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            For if $x\in{f}^{-1}(B_{1})$, then there is a
            $y\in{B}_{1}$ such that $f(x)=y$. But
            $B_{1}\subseteq{B}_{2}$, and therefore $y\in{B}_{2}$.
            Thus, $x\in{f}^{-1}(B_{2})$. Therefore, etc.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
        If $f:A\rightarrow B$, $A_1,A_2\subset A$, then $f(A_1 \cup A_2) = f(A_1)\cup f(A_2)$.

        \begin{proof}
        $[y\in f(A_1 \cap A_2)]\Rightarrow [\exists x\in A_1 \cap A_2:y=f(x)]\Rightarrow [x\in A_1 \land x \in A_2] \Rightarrow[y \in f(A_1)\cap f(A_2)]$.

        \begin{proof}
        $[x\in f^{-1}(B\setminus B_1)]\Leftrightarrow [f(x)\notin B_1]\Leftrightarrow [x\in f^{-1}(B)\setminus f^{-1}(B_1)]$
        \end{proof}
        If $f:A\rightarrow B$, the image of $A$ under $f$
        is often called the range (A is often called the domain).
        \begin{ldefinition}{Permutations}{Permutations}
            A permutation on a set $A$ is a bijective function
            $f:A\rightarrow{A}$.
        \end{ldefinition}
        \begin{theorem}
        If $f:A\rightarrow B$ is bijective, then $f^{-1}$ is bijective.

        $[f^{-1}(y_1) = f^{-1}(y_2)]\Rightarrow [\exists x\in A:[f(x) = y_1]\land [f(x)=y_2]]\Rightarrow [y_1=y_2]$. By definition, $f^{-1}$ is surjective.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{definition}
        If $f:A\rightarrow B$ and $g:B\rightarrow C$, then $g\circ f:A\rightarrow C$ is defined by the image $g(f(x)), x\in A$.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{theorem}

        \begin{theorem}

        $\big[[f(A) = B]\land [g(B) = C]\big]\Rightarrow [g(f(A)) = g(B) = C]$. $[g(f(x_1))=g(f(x_2))]\Leftrightarrow [f(x_1)=f(x_2)]\Leftrightarrow [x_1=x_2]$.

        \end{proof}
        \begin{lexample}{}{Image_is_Nonempty}
            Given a function $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$, and any
            non-empty subset $S\subseteq{X}$, the image
            $f(S)$ is non-empty. This is not true for the
            pre-image of a function. For let
            $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ be defined by
            $f(x)=1$ for all $x\in\mathbb{R}$. Then, for any
            subset $S\subset\mathbb{R}$ such that
            $1\notin{S}$, we have that
            $f^{\minus{1}}(S)=\emptyset$.
        \end{lexample}
        There are many examples of functions, but certain
        ones are easier to study than others. We give some
        of these special functions names.
        \begin{ldefinition}{Injective Functions}
              {Funct_Analysis_Injective_Function}
            An \gls{injective function} is a function
            $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ such that, for all
            $x,y\in{X}$ such that $x\ne{y}$, it is true that
            $f(x)\ne{f}(y)$.
        \end{ldefinition}
        That is, an injective function is a function
        $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ such that $f(x_{1})=f(x_{2})$
        if and only if $x_{1}=x_{2}$. Such functions are also
        called \textit{one-to-one}.
        \begin{lexample}{}{Natural_Log_is_Injective}
            Consider the natural logarithm
            $\ln:\mathbb{R}^{+}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$. This
            is an injective function. For let
            $x,y\in\mathbb{R}^{+}$ be such that $x\ne{y}$.
            Suppose $\ln(x)=\ln(y)$. But then:
            \begin{equation}
                \ln(x)-\ln(y)=\ln\Big(\frac{x}{y}\Big)=0
            \end{equation}
            Recall the definition of the natural logarithm:
            \begin{equation}
                \ln(t)=\int_{1}^{t}\frac{1}{x}\diff{x}
            \end{equation}
            But then $\ln(t)=0$ if and only if $t=1$. Thus
            $x=y$, a contradiction. Therefore $\ln$ is an
            injective function. Not every function is
            injective, for define
            $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ by
            $f(x)=x^{2}$. Then, for all $x\in\mathbb{R}^{+}$,
            $f(\minus{x})=f(x)$, and thus $f$ cannot be an
            injective function.
        \end{lexample}
        One might think that most functions are not injective,
        and indeed for the \textit{finite} case, this is true.
        For let $A$ and $B$ be finite sets with $n$ and $m$
        elements, respectively. If $m<n$, there can't be
        any injective function. Consider the case when $n=m$.
        Then we are simply counting the number of ways to
        permute the elements of $A$. This is $n!$. On the
        other hand, the total number of functions is
        $n^{n}$. Thus, the ratio of the number of injective
        functions to the number of functions is
        $n!/n^{n}$, and this decays to zero rapidly as
        $n$ get's large. Finally, if $m>n$, then the total
        number of injective functions is
        $n!\binom{m}{n}$, where $\binom{m}{n}$ is the
        binomial coefficient. The total number of functions
        is $n^{m}$. The ratio is thus:
        \begin{equation}
            \frac{n!\binom{m}{n}}{n^{m}}=
            \frac{n!\frac{m!}{n!(m-n)!}}{n^{m}}
            =\frac{m!}{(m-n)!n^{m}}
        \end{equation}
        And again, this decays rapidly to zero and $n$ and $m$
        get large. Later, when we define infinite sets
        and the notion of Cardinality, we'll show that this
        trend continues. That is, in a sense, \textit{most}
        functions from a set $A$ to a sufficiently large set
        $B$ are not injective.
        \begin{ldefinition}{Inverse of Injective Functions}
                           {Inverse_Function}
            The inverse of an injective function $f:A\rightarrow{B}$
            is the function $f^{-1}:f(A)\rightarrow{A}$ defined by
            $f^{-1}(y)=x$, where $x\in{A}$ is the unique element
            such that $f(x)=y$.
        \end{ldefinition}
        Next, we define \textit{surjective} functions.
        \begin{ldefinition}{Surjective Functions}
              {Funct_Analysis_Surjective_Function}
            A \gls{surjective function} is a function
            $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ such that $f(X)=Y$.
            That is, for all $y\in{Y}$, there is an
            $x\in{X}$ such that $f(x)=y$.
        \end{ldefinition}
        That is, every point $y\in{Y}$ gets mapped to by
        at least one point in $X$. It may also be true that
        many points in $X$ map to the same point in $Y$.
        The notions of surjective functions and injective
        functions are distinct, and neither implies the
        other. Surjective functions are also called
        \textit{onto}.
        \begin{ldefinition}{Bijective Functions}
              {Funct_Analysis_Bijective_Function}
            A \gls{bijective function} is a function
            that is both injective and surjective.
        \end{ldefinition}
        Sets $X$ and $Y$ such that there
        exists a bijective function $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$ are
        called \textit{equivalent}. Such sets can be said
        to have the same size. We say that $X$ is strictly
        smaller than $Y$ if there is an injective function
        $f:X\rightarrow{Y}$, but no bijective function.
        Being countable means you can write
        the elements out in a list, or a
        one-to-one correspondence with all of
        the positive integers. Many sets are countable,
        including the whole numbers, integers, rational
        numbers, and \textit{algebraic} numbers. The
        union of finitely many countable sets is also
        countable, as is the union of countably many
        countable sets.
        \begin{example}
            The set of all positive even integers is
            countable. For let $\mathbb{N}_{e}$ be the
            set of all even integers and define
            $f:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{N}_{e}$ be
            $f(n)=2n$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$. This is
            a bijection, and thus $\mathbb{N}_{e}$ is
            countable. The set of all odd positive integers
            is countable, as shown by letting
            $f(n)=2n-1$. Even though the set of even
            integers may seem ``smaller,'' than the set of
            all integers, they are equivalent. The set of
            all integers $\mathbb{Z}$ is also countable.
            For let $f:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}$
            be defined as:
            \begin{equation}
                f(n)=
                \begin{cases}
                    \frac{1}{2}(n-1),&n\textrm{ odd}\\
                    -\frac{n}{2},&n\textrm{ even}
                \end{cases}
            \end{equation}
        \end{example}
        Any set that is infinite (Not finite) contains a
        countable subset. Thus, $\mathbb{N}$ can be
        considered as the \textit{smallest} infinite set.
        \begin{theorem}
            If $A$ is an infinite set, then there exists
            $S\subseteq{A}$ such that $S$ is countabl e.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            For as $A$ is infinite, for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$
            there exists a set $B\subseteq{A}$ such that
            $|B|=n$. For all $n\in\mathbb{N}$,
            define the following:
            \begin{equation}
                \mathcal{S}_{n}=\{B\subseteq{A}:|B|=n\}
            \end{equation}
            Let $\mathcal{S}$ be defined as:
            \begin{equation}
                \mathcal{S}=\{\mathcal{S}_{n}:n\in\mathbb{N}\}
            \end{equation}
            Then $\mathcal{S}$ is countable, for
            $a:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathcal{S}$ defined
            by $a_{n}=\mathcal{S}_{n}$ is a bijection.
            By the axiom of choice, there is a function:
            \begin{equation}
                \alpha:\mathcal{S}\rightarrow
                \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}\mathcal{S}_{n}
            \end{equation}
            Such that, for all $x\in\mathcal{S}$,
            $\alpha(x)\in{x}$. But then, for all
            $x\in\mathcal{S}$, $\alpha(x)$ is a subset
            of $A$. But for all $x\in\mathcal{S}$, there
            is an $n\in\mathbb{N}$ such that
            $a_{n}=x$. Thus, let $S$ be the following:
            \begin{equation}
                S=\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}\alpha(a_{n})
            \end{equation}
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
            \label{thm:Funct_Countable_Union_of_Countable}
            If $A$ is a countable set such that for all
            $\mathcal{U}\in{A}$, $\mathcal{U}$ is a
            countable set, and if for all $a,b\in{A}$,
            $a\cap{b}=\emptyset$, then
            $\bigcup_{\mathcal{U}\in{A}}\mathcal{U}$
            is countable set.
        \end{theorem}
        \textit{Sketch of Proof.} The proof of
        Thm.~\ref{thm:Funct_Countable_Union_of_Countable}
        follows in the same manner
        as proving that the rationals are countable. Since
        there are countably many sets, write them out in
        a list $\mathcal{U}_{1}$, $\mathcal{U}_{2}$, and
        so on. Then write out the elements in a table as
        follows:
        \begin{table}[H]

            \centering
            \begin{tabular}{ccccc}

                &$u_{14}$&$\hdots$\\
                $u_{21}$&$u_{22}$&$u_{23}$
                &$u_{24}$&$\hdots$\\

        Where $u_{nm}$ is the $m^{th}$ element of
        $\mathcal{U}_{n}$.
        Using the \textit{diagonal argument},
        we obtain:

                $\bigcup_{\mathcal{U}\in{A}}\mathcal{U}$&
                $u_{11}$&$u_{12}$&$u_{21}$&$u_{13}$&
                $u_{22}$&$u_{31}$&$u_{14}$&$u_{23}$&
                $u_{32}$&$\hdots$\\
                \hline
            \end{tabular}
            \caption{The Bijection Between $\mathbb{N}$ and
                     $\bigcup_{\mathcal{U}\in{A}}\mathcal{U}$}
            \label{table:Func_Bijection_on_Countable_Union}
        \end{table}
        In the absence of the requirement that
        $a\cap{b}=\emptyset$ for all pairs in $\mathcal{U}$,
        we still have that the union is, at most, countable.
        The mapping we found would be a
        \textit{surjection}, rather than a bijection.
        The union is then either finite or countable. The
        Cantor-Schr\"{o}der-Bernstein Theorem can often be
        used to help identify the size of a set. This says
        that if $A$ and $B$ are sets such that there exists
        a surjective function $f:A\rightarrow{B}$ and a
        surjective function $g:B\rightarrow{A}$, then there
        is a bijective function $h:A\rightarrow{B}$. The
        requirement that $f$ and $g$ both be surjective
        can be replaced with the requirement that they both
        be injective. This is similar to saying that if
        $\mathrm{Card}(A)\leq\mathrm{Card}(B)$ and
        $\mathrm{Card}(B)\leq\mathrm{Card}(A)$,
        then $\mathrm{Card}(A)=\mathrm{Card}(B)$. Here, $\mathrm{Card}(A)$
        denotes the \textit{cardinality} of the set $A$.
        \begin{theorem}
            $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable.
        \end{theorem}
        \textit{Sketch of Proof.} We'll show that the unit
        interval $(0,1)$ is uncountable. Suppose not.
        Let $r_{ij}$ be the $j^{th}$ decimal of the $i^{th}$
        element in the list. We construct the real number
        $d$ as follows: If $d_{j}$ denotes the $j^{th}$
        decimal in $d$, let $d_{j}=r_{jj}+1$ if
        $r_{jj}\ne{9}$, and $d_{j}=0$ otherwise. Then
        $d\in(0,1)$, but $d$ is not on the list. For it's not
        the $n^{th}$ element, for it differs in the
        $n^{th}$ decimal place. Thus there is no bijection.
        Therefore, $(0,1)$ is uncountable. By extension,
        $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable.
        \par\hfill\par
        \vspace{-2ex}
        For a set $X$, we often write
        $\mathcal{P}(X)$ to denote the
        \textit{power set} of $X$. This is the
        set of all subsets of $X$.
        For any set $X$ you can show that $X$ is
        strictly smaller than $\mathcal{P}(X)$.
        For example, $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$
        can be shown to be equivalent to $\mathbb{R}$.
        Since $\mathbb{N}$ is stricly smaller than
        $\mathbb{R}$, one might ask if there exists
        a set $X$ such that $\mathbb{N}$ is strictly
        smaller than $X$, but $X$ is strictly smaller
        than $\mathbb{R}$. Continuing, you can ask the
        same thing about $\mathbb{R}$ and
        $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R})$, and so on.
        This is called the continuum hypothesis.
        It turns out to be independent of
        the standard axioms of mathematics.
        We begin by talking about cardinality. This is the
        \textit{size} of a set. For an infinite set it
        doesn't make sense to talk about the \textit{number}
        of elements, but we can specify what it means two
        sets to have the same size.
        \begin{ldefinition}{Equivalent Sets}{Equivalent_Sets}
            Equivalent sets are set $A$ and $B$ such that
            there exists a bijection $f:A\rightarrow{B}$.
        \end{ldefinition}
        The notion of equivalent sets defines an equivalence
        relation on sets. That is, the notion is reflexive,
        symmetric, and transitive.
        \begin{theorem}
            If $A$ is a set, then $A$ is equivalent to $A$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            For let $\mathrm{id}_{A}:A\rightarrow{A}$
            be the identity mapping, $\mathrm{id}_{A}(x)=x$,
            then $\mathrm{id}_{A}$ is a bijection, and thus
            $A$ is equivalent to $A$.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
            If $A$ and $B$ are sets and if $A$ is equivalent
            to $B$, then $B$ is equivalent to $A$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            For if $A$ is equivalent to $B$, then there is
            a bijection $f:A\rightarrow{B}$. But if $f$ is a
            bijection, then the inverse function
            $f^{-1}:B\rightarrow{A}$ is well-defined and is
            a bijection. Thus $B$ is equivalent to $A$.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
            If $A$, $B$, and $C$ are sets, if $A$ is
            equivalent to $B$, and if $B$ is equivalent to
            $C$, then $A$ is equivalent to $C$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            For if $A$ is equivalent to $B$, then there is
            a bijection $f:A\rightarrow{B}$. But if $B$ is
            equivalent ot $C$, then there is a bijection
            $g:B\rightarrow{C}$. But then
            $g\circ{f}:A\rightarrow{C}$ is a bijection, and
            thus $A$ and $C$ are equivalent.
        \end{proof}
        A bijection is a function that is both injective and
        surjective. Thus, two equivalent sets can be put
        into a one-to-one correspondence and can be said to
        have the same size. We then say that $A$ and $B$
        have the same cardinality. The notation is written
        as $|A|=|B|$ or $\mathrm{Card}(A)=\mathrm{Card}(B)$. Cardinality
        splits sets into one of three categories.
        \begin{ldefinition}{Finite Sets}{Finite_Sets}
            A finite set is a set $A$ such that there exists
            an $n\in\mathbb{N}$ such that there is a
            bijection $f:\mathbb{Z}_{n}\rightarrow{A}$, or
            such that $A=\emptyset$.
        \end{ldefinition}
        Sets that are not finite are called infinite. There
        are two types of infinite sets. Let $\mathbb{N}$
        denote the set of positive integers, or
        \textit{natural} numbers.
        \begin{ldefinition}{Countably Infinite Sets}
              {Countably_Infinite}
            A countably infinite set is a set $A$ such that
            is a bijection $f:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow{A}$.
        \end{ldefinition}
        Combining the notions of finite sets and countably
        infinite sets, we get the notion of
        \textit{countable} sets.
        \begin{ldefinition}{Countable Sets}
              {Countable_Sets}
            A countable set is a set $A$ such that $A$ is
            either finite or countably infinite.
        \end{ldefinition}
        Countable sets are also called \textit{listable}.
        This is because if $A$ is a countably infinite set,
        and if $a:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow{A}$ is a bijection,
        we can write $A$ as:
        \begin{equation}
            A=\{\;a_{n}\,:\,n\in\mathbb{N}\;\}
            =\{\,a_{1},\,a_{2},\,\dots,\,a_{k},\,\dots\,\}
        \end{equation}
        If $A$ is finite, and if
        $a:\mathbb{Z}_{n}\rightarrow{A}$ is a
        bijection, then we can write:
        \begin{equation}
            A=\{\;a_{n}\,:\,n\in\mathbb{Z}_{n}\;\}
             =\{\,a_{1},\,\dots,\,a_{n}\,\}
        \end{equation}
        Recall that functions $a:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow{A}$
        are called \textit{sequences}, and the image of
        $n\in\mathbb{N}$ is written $a_{n}$, rather than
        $a(n)$.
        \begin{lexample}{}{Countable_Sets}
            There are many commonly discussed sets that are
            countably infinite. $\mathbb{N}$ is a trivial
            such example, but also $\mathbb{N}_{e}$ and
            $\mathbb{N}_{o}$, the sets of even and odd
            positive integers, respectively. For consider as
            bijections the following functions:

                The set of all integers, $\mathbb{Z}$ is also
                countable, as shown in
                Fig.~\ref{fig:Bijection_N_and_Z}.
                One bijection is:
                \begin{equation}
                    f(n)=
                    \begin{cases}

                \end{equation}
            \end{subequations}
            Any subset of $\mathbb{Z}$ is countable,
            and this is true of any countable set.

        One of the standard results about countable sets is
        that their subsets are also countable. This theorem
        relies, in a very subtle way, the use of the axiom
        of choice. There are a few stepping stones to get
        there. We will accept the various
        Cantor-Schr\"{o}eder-Bernstein theorems, which say
        the following:
        \begin{ltheorem}
              {First Cantor-Schr\"{o}eder-Bernstein Theorem}
              {First_Cantor_Schroeder_Bernstein}
            If $A$ and $B$ are sets such that there is an injective
            function $f:A\rightarrow{B}$ and an injective function
            $g:B\rightarrow{A}$, then there is a bijective function
            $h:A\rightarrow{B}$.
        \end{ltheorem}
        \begin{ltheorem}
              {Second Cantor-Schr\"{o}eder-Bernstein Theorem}
              {Second_Cantor_Schroeder_Bernstein}
            If $A$ and $B$ are sets such that there is a surjective
            function $f:A\rightarrow{B}$ and a surjective function
            $g:B\rightarrow{A}$, then there is a bijective function
            $h:A\rightarrow{B}$.
        \end{ltheorem}
        \par\hfill\par
        Using cardinalities, this says that if
        $\mathrm{Card}(A)\leq\mathrm{Card}(B)$ and $\mathrm{Card}(B)\leq\mathrm{Card}(A)$, then
        $\mathrm{Card}(A)=\mathrm{Card}(B)$. With this notation it becomes more
        intuitive. We will use this to prove that various sets are
        countable. Many sets that appear to be larger than $\mathbb{N}$
        can shown to to be the same size as $\mathbb{N}$ by finding
        a simple injective function, without finding an explicit
        bijection.

              {Third Cantor-Schr\"{o}eder-Bernstein Theorem}
              {Third_Cantor_Schroeder_Bernstein}
            If $A$, $B$, and $C$ are sets such that
            $A\subseteq{B}\subseteq{C}$, and if $A$ and $C$ are equivalent
            sets, then $B$ and $C$ are equivalent sets.
        \end{ltheorem}
        \par\hfill\par
        This says that if $\mathrm{Card}(A)\leq\mathrm{Card}(B)\leq\mathrm{Card}(C)$,
        and if $\mathrm{Card}(A)=\mathrm{Card}(C)$, then $\mathrm{Card}(B)=\mathrm{Card}(C)$.
        \begin{theorem}
            \label{thm:Measure_Theory_NxN_Is_Countable}
            $\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}$ is countably infinite.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            There is a trivial injection
            $f:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}$
            defined by:
            \begin{equation}
                f(n)=(n,0)
            \end{equation}
            There is also an injection
            $g:\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$
            defined by:
            \begin{equation}
                g(n.m)=2^{n}3^{m}
            \end{equation}
            Since 2 and 3 are co-prime, if
            $g(n_{1},m_{1})=g(n_{2},m_{2})$, then
            $(n_{1},m_{1})=(n_{2},m_{2})$. Thus, $g$ is an injection.
            By the Cantor-Schr\"{o}eder-Bernstein Theorem, there is a
            bijection $h:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}$.
        \end{proof}
        One can intuitively see that the set of all positive
        rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}^{+}$ is countable by examining
        the zig-zag pattern shown in
        Fig.~\ref{fig:Bijection_N_and_Q_Plus}.
        Thm.~\ref{thm:Measure_Theory_NxN_Is_Countable} also
        shows this in a more rigorous way that. We can create
        a one-to-one correspondence with
        $\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}$ by mapping
        $pq^{\minus{1}}\mapsto(p,q)$. Thus $\mathbb{Q}^{+}$
        and $\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}$ are equivalent sets.
        But $\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{N}$
        are equivalent sets, and therefore $\mathbb{Q}^{+}$
        is countable.
        Thm.~\ref{thm:Measure_Theory_NxN_Is_Countable} can also be used
        to show that the countable union of countable sets is also
        countable.
        \begin{ltheorem}{Equivalence of Countable Sets}
              {Countable_iff_exists_inj_to_N}
            A set $A$ is countable if and only if there is an injective
            function $f:A\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$.
        \end{ltheorem}
        Thm.~\ref{thm:Countable_iff_exists_inj_to_N} seems
        intuitively obvious, the injective function is
        simply the listing function. For a finite set, this
        is precisely how one constructs such an injection.
        For an infinite set $A$, this is equivalent to
        showing that any infinite subset of $\mathbb{N}$ is
        equivalent to $\mathbb{N}$. The standard proof
        using \textit{induction}, but actually has the axiom
        of choice underlying it.
        \begin{theorem}
            If $\mathcal{A}$ is a countably infinite set
            such that, for all $A\in\mathcal{A}$, $A$ is
            a non-empty countable set, then the set:
            \begin{equation}
                S=\bigcup_{A\in\mathcal{A}}A
            \end{equation}
            Is a countable set.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            If $\mathcal{F}$ is finite, then we are done. Suppose not.
            Let $A:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathcal{A}$ be a bijection,
            and define:
            \begin{equation}
                S=\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb{N}}A_{n}
            \end{equation}
            Also, let:
            \begin{equation}
                \mathcal{F}_{n}
                =\{f:A_{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{N}:
                    f\textrm{ is injective}\}
            \end{equation}
            Since, for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$, $A_{n}$ is
            non-empty and countable, $\mathcal{F}_{n}$
            is non-empty. Let:
            \begin{equation}
                \mathcal{F}
                =\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\mathcal{F}_{n}
            \end{equation}
            Thus, by the axiom of choice, there is a function
            $F:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathcal{F}$ such that, for all
            $n\in\mathbb{N}$, $F_{n}\in\mathcal{F}_{n}$. For
            $x\in{S}$, let:
            \begin{equation}
                \varphi_{x}
                =\inf\{n\in\mathbb{N}:x\in{A}_{n}\}
            \end{equation}
            By the well-ordering of $\mathbb{N}$, for all
            $x\in{S}$, $\varphi_{x}$ is well defined. Let
            $\phi:S\rightarrow\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}$
            be defined by:
            \begin{equation}
                \phi(x)
                =\big(\varphi_{x},F_{\varphi_{x}}(x)\big)
            \end{equation}
            Then $\phi$ is an injection. For if
            $\big(\varphi_{x},F_{\varphi_{x}}(x)\big)=%
             \big(\varphi_{y},F_{\varphi_{x}}(y)\big)$, then
            $\varphi_{x}=\varphi_{y}$, and thus
            $F_{\varphi(x)}(x)=F_{\varphi(x)}(y)$. But
            $F_{\varphi_{x}}$ is an injection, and
            thus $x=y$. Therefore $\phi$ is an injection.
            But $\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{N}$
            are equivalent sets, and thus there's an
            injection $f:\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}$. And
            the composition of injective functions is again
            injective, and thus
            $\phi\circ{f}:S\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$ is an
            injective function. But by
            Thm.~\ref{thm:Countable_iff_exists_inj_to_N},
            if there is an injective function
            $f:S\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$, then $S$ is
            countable. Therefore, etc.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
            If $X$ is infinite, then there exists a
            countably infinite set $A\subseteq{X}$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            If $A$ is finite, then we are done. Suppose not.
            For $n\in\mathbb{N}$, let:
            \begin{equation}
                A_{n}
                =\{g:\mathbb{Z}_{n}\rightarrow{A}:f\textrm{ is inective}\}
            \end{equation}
            Also, define:
            \begin{equation}
                \mathcal{F}=\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb{N}}A_{n}
            \end{equation}
            But by the axiom of choice, there is a function
            $f:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathcal{F}$ such that
            $f_{n}\in{A}_{n}$. But then, for all
            $n\in\mathbb{N}$, the range of $f_{n}$ is finite.
            \begin{equation}
                A=\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb{N}}f_{n}
                    \Big(\mathbb{Z}_{n}\Big)
            \end{equation}
            Then $A\subseteq{X}$ is countably infinite.
        \end{proof}
        The set of rational numbers, $\mathbb{Q}$, is also
        countable. We may intuitively think of $\mathbb{N}$
        as being smaller than $\mathbb{Q}$, since there are
        simple \textit{surjections} that can be constructed
        from $\mathbb{Q}$ to $\mathbb{N}$. There is also a
        surjection from $\mathbb{N}$ onto $\mathbb{Q}^{+}$,
        as is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Bijection_N_and_Q_Plus}.
        To construct such a surjection, write out all of the
        positive rational numbers in a grid so that $a_{nm}$
        is the number $n/m$. Then zig-zag along the diagonals
        to construct the function. Thus there is a surjection
        $f:\mathbb{Q}^{+}\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$
        and a surjection
        $g:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{Q}^{+}$.
        \begin{figure}[H]

            \captionsetup{type=figure}

            \label{fig:Bijection_N_and_Q_Plus}
        \end{figure}
        We can modify Fig.~\ref{fig:Bijection_N_and_Q_Plus}
        slightly to create a surjection between $\mathbb{N}$
        and $\mathbb{Q}$, see
        Fig.~\ref{fig:Bijection_N_and_Q}.
        It is important to note that this bijection will not
        preserve the order of the rational numbers. The
        bijection will have to jump around back and forth.
        Any such bijection will be forced to do this, as the
        rationals are everywhere dense on $\mathbb{R}$. Any
        monotonic sequence of $\mathbb{Q}$ cannot possibly
        be a bijection.
        \begin{theorem}
            If $A$ is a countably infinite set and
            $B\subseteq{A}$, then $B$ is countable.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            As $A$ is countably infinite, there is a bijection
            $a:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow{A}$. Define:
            \begin{equation}
                K=\{n\in\mathbb{N}:a_{n}\in{B}\}
            \end{equation}
            As $B\subseteq{A}$,
            this set contains a subsequence of points in
            $\mathbb{N}$ that get mapped into $B$. If $K$ is finite,
            then $B$ is finite, and if not then $K$ is countably
            infinite, and thus $B$ is countably infinite.
        \end{proof}

        \begin{theorem}
            If $A$ is an infinite set, then there exists a
            countable subset $B\subseteq{A}$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            If $A$ is infinite then there is an
            $a_{1}\in{A}$. But, as $A$ is infinite,
            $A\setminus\{a_{1}\}$ is infinite, and there
            is an $a_{2}\in{A}\setminus\{a_{1}\}$. Continuing
            we obtain a sequence of distinct elements in $A$.
            Let $B=\{a_{n}:n\in\mathbb{N}\}$. Then
            $B\subseteq{A}$, and $B$ is countable.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{lexample}{}{Disjoint_Union_of_Intervals_is_Countable}
            Suppose we have a collection of disjoint intervals
            of $\mathbb{R}$. This collection is either finite
            or countable. For in every interval, choose a
            rational number $q_{n}$. Let
            $A=\{q_{1},q_{2},\hdots\}$. Then
            $A\subseteq\mathbb{Q}$, and thus $A$ is either
            finite or countable. But this is also an enumeration
            of the intervals in the collection, and thus the
            collection is either finite or countable.
        \end{lexample}
        Given a countable collection of sets
        $A=\{\mathcal{A}_{1},\mathcal{A}_{2},\hdots\}$ such
        that, for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$, $\mathcal{A}_{n}$ is
        also a countable set, then the union is countable. That is:
        \begin{equation}
            B=\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}\mathcal{A}_{n}
        \end{equation}
        is a countable set. The proof of this is a mimicry of
        the proof of the countability of $\mathbb{Q}$. Not
        every set is either finite or countable. The real numbers,
        $\mathbb{R}$, is an example of an \textit{uncountable}
        set. First, some notes on the power set of a set.
        \begin{lexample}{}{Basic_Power_Set}
            \begin{subequations}
                If $\Omega=\{1,2\}$, then the power set is:
                \begin{equation}
                    \mathcal{P}(\Omega)=
                    \big\{\emptyset,\{1\},\{2\},\{1,2\}\big\}
                \end{equation}
                We must consider the empty set, since for any set
                $A$, $\emptyset\subseteq{A}$. As another example,
                let $\Omega=\{1,2,3\}$. Then:
                \begin{equation}
                    \mathcal{P}(\Omega)=
                    \big\{\emptyset,\{1\},\{2\},\{3\},\{1,2\},
                      \{1,3\},\{2,3\},\{1,2,3\}\big\}
                \end{equation}
                We see that, in the first example, a set with
                2 elements has a power set with 4 elements. In the
                second example we see that a set with 3 elements has
                a power set with 8 elements. This pattern continues
                for finite sets. If $A$ has $n$ elements, then
                $\mathcal{P}(A)$ has $2^{n}$ elements. If
                $A$ is an infinite set, then $\mathcal{P}(A)$ is
                uncountable. Indeed:
                \begin{equation}
                    \mathrm{Card}\big(\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})\big)=
                    \mathrm{Card}(\mathbb{R})
                \end{equation}
                We can show this by using the binary representation
                of real numbers. We construct a bijection as
                follows: If $A\subseteq\mathbb{N}$, then
                let $r_{A}=0.n_{1}n_{2}\hdots$ where:
                \begin{equation}
                    n_{i}=
                    \begin{cases}
                        0,&i\notin{A}\\
                        1,&i\in{A}
                    \end{cases}
                \end{equation}
                The function
                $f:\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})\rightarrow[0,1]$
                defined by $f(A)=r_{A}$ is thus a bijection.
                That is, every element of $[0,1]$ gets mapped to in
                a one-to-one manner. The potentially tricky numbers are
                0 and 1, but $f(\emptyset)=0$, and $f(\mathbb{N})=1$.
                Thus $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$ and $[0,1]$ are of the
                same cardinality. But $(0,1)$ and $\mathbb{R}$
                are of the same cardinality. To see this, consider
                the graph of the function
                $g:(0,1)\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ defined as:
                \begin{equation}
                    g(x)=\frac{2x-1}{x(1-x)}
                \end{equation}
                This is a bijection between the unit interval
                $(0,1)$ and $\mathbb{R}$. One can also use the
                \textit{stereographic projection} to show this.
                But also $[0,1]$ and $(0,1)$ have the same cardinality.
                For this, consider the following function:
                \begin{equation}
                    f(x)=
                    \begin{cases}
                        \frac{1}{2},&x=0\\
                        \frac{1}{2^{n+2}},&x=\frac{1}{2^{n}}\\
                        x,&\textrm{Otherwise}
                    \end{cases}
                \end{equation}
                A graph of this is shown in
                Fig.~\ref{fig:Measure_Theory_Bijection_Closed_I_to_Open}.
                Therefore, $\mathbb{R}$ and
                $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$ have the same cardinality.
                This can then be used to show that $\mathbb{R}$ is
                uncountable.

        The power set of any set is strictly larger than the
        original set. If $\Omega$ is finite with $n$ elements, it
        can be shown that $\mathcal{P}(\Omega)$ has $2^{n}$
        elements. For infinite sets, there is a trivial surjection
        from $\mathcal{P}(\Omega)$ onto $\Omega$: for any element
        $x$, let $f(\{x\})=x$. This shows that
        $\mathrm{Card}(\Omega)\leq\mathrm{Card}(\mathcal{P}(\Omega))$. We now show
        that the inequality is strict.
        \begin{theorem}
            If $\Omega$ is a set, then there is no bijection
            $f:\Omega\rightarrow\mathcal{P}(\Omega)$
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            For suppose not, and let
            $f:\Omega\rightarrow\mathcal{P}(\Omega)$ be such a
            bijection. Define:
            \begin{equation}
                A=\{x\in\Omega:x\in{f}(x)\}
            \end{equation}
            Then $A\subseteq\Omega$, and thus
            $A\in\mathcal{P}(\Omega)$. But then the complement of
            $A$ is also an element of $\mathcal{P}(\Omega)$. But
            $f$ is a bijection and thus there is an $x\in\Omega$
            such that $f(x)=A^{C}$. If $x\in{f}(x)$, then
            $x\in{A}$, a contradiction as $f(x)=A^{C}$, and thus
            $x\in{A}^{C}$ as well. Therefore $x\notin{f}(x)$. But
            then $x\in{A}^{C}$. But, from the definition of $A$,
            since $x\in{A}^{C}$ and $f(x)=A^{C}$, $x\in{f}(x)$
            and thus $x\in{A}$, a contradiction. Thus there is no
            $x$ such that $f(x)=A^{C}$. Therefore, $f$ is not a
            bijection.
        \end{proof}
        From this we conclude that $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$
        is an uncountable infinite set. But since $\mathbb{R}$
        and $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$ have the same cardinality,
        $\mathbb{R}$ is also uncountable.
        If a set $A$ has the same cardinality as $\mathbb{R}$,
        we say that $A$ has the cardinality of the continuum.

            There is a bijection between the open unit
            square $(0,1)\times(0,1)$ and the open unit interval
            $(0,1)$. For an element $(x,y)\in(0,1)\times(0,1)$,
            let $z\in(0,1)$ be defined as
            $z=0.x_{1}y_{1}x_{2}y_{2}x_{3}y_{3}\dots$ This is
            a bijection, for all $(x,y)$ in the square there is
            a corresponding $z\in(0,1)$, and for all
            $z\in(0,1)$ there is a corresponding element of
            $(0,1)\times(0,1)$. We can say that $(x,y)$ can
            be coded into $z$, and $z$ can be decoded into
            $(x,y)$. Hence, $(0,1)\times(0,1)$ has the cardinality
            of the continuum. By stereographic projection and induction
            we obtain:

        \begin{lexample}{}{Space_of_Sequences}
            Consider the set of all real-valued sequences. We've seen
            that any real number can be represented as a function
            $f:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\{0,1\}$. A real-valued sequence
            is a function $a:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$, and
            thus the set of real-valued sequences can be seen as the
            set of functions whose domain is $\mathbb{N}$ and whose
            range is the set of all functions
            $f:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\{0,1\}$. So given a sequence
            $a$, the image of $a_{n}$, for $n\in\mathbb{N}$, is a
            function $f_{n}:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\{0,1\}$. Therefore
            the set of all real-valued sequences can be represented
            as the set of all functions
            $g:\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\{0,1\}$, where
            $g(n,m)=f_{n}(m)$. But $\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}$ is
            countable, and thus the set of all functions of the form
            $g:\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\{0,1\}$ has the
            same cardinality as the set of all functions of the form
            $f:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\{0,1\}$. But this has the
            cardinality of the continuum. Therefore, the set of all
            real-valued sequences has the cardinality of the continuum.
