        We now add more structure by considering a set with two operations.
        Everything we've studied so far (semigroups, quasigroups, monoids,
        groups) has had only one operation associated to it, but in the most
        fundamental forms of arithmetic there are two. The only structure we've
        encountered with two operations so far has been Boolean algebras
        (see Book~\ref{book:Foundations}), but as we will see when we study
        topology, there is essentialy only one type of Boolean algebra and thus
        this study is, in a sense, complete. If we are going to axiomitize some
        algebraic structure it is then wise to avoid recreating Boolean algebras
        and so instead we try to model the arithmetic of the real numbers. The
        most fundamental properties can be stated quite succintly:
        $\monoid[][+]{\mathbb{R}}$ is an Abelian group and
        $\monoid[][\cdot]{\mathbb{R}}$ is a monoid. We cannot just leave it
        there, however, since we've no way of knowing how $+$ and $\cdot$ play
        together. As presented, we have two potentially unrelated binary
        operations and thus cannot procede any further. To complete our
        structure, we add \glslink{distributive operation}{distributivity}.
