        We now add more structure by considering a set with two operations.
        Everything thus far (semi-groups, quasi-groups, monoids, groups) has
        had only one operation associated to it, but in the most fundamental
        forms of arithmetic there are two. The only structure we've encountered
        with two operations so far has been Boolean algebras
        (see Book~\ref{book:Foundations}), but as well will see when we study
        topology, there is essentialy only one type of Boolean algebra and thus
        this study is, in a sense, complete. If we are going to axiomitize some
        algebraic structure it is then wise to avoid all of the properties of
        a Boolean algebra, and so instead we try to model the arithmetic of the
        real numbers. The most fundamental properties can be stated quite
        succintly: $(\mathbb{R},+)$ is an Abelian group and
        $(\mathbb{R},\cdot\,)$ is a monoid. We cannot just leave it there,
        however, since we've no way of knowing how $+$ and $\cdot$ play
        together. As presented, we have two potentially unrelated binary
        operations and thus we cannot procede any further. To complete our
        structure, we add the
        \glslink{distributive operation}{distributive property}.
