    \section{Introduction}
        We use the following notation:
        \begin{equation}
            [n]=\mathbb{Z}_{n}=\{1,2,\hdots,n\}
        \end{equation}
        In combinatorics we study functions of the form
        $f:[n]\rightarrow[m]$. These functions can be
        one-to-one, onto, or both. A permutation of the
        elements of $[n]$ is simply a bijection
        $f:[n]\rightarrow[n]$. A partial permutation is a
        permutation of length $k\leq{n}$ of the set
        $[n]$. That is, a permutation on some subset of
        $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$. We all study sets. In particular,
        the power set of $[n]$ and subsets from $k$ chosen
        elements of $[n]$. Another topic of study is that of
        lattice paths on $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$. That
        it, paths from $(i,j)$ to $(n,m)$ using a prescribed
        set of rules. For example, how many ways can you get
        from $(0,0)$ to $(21,7)$ if you're only allowed to move
        North and East. Restricted paths impose more rules,
        for example the number of moves east must be greater
        than the number of moves north. There are also things
        called Catalan paths and Motzkin paths.
        \par\hfill\par
        Another topic in combinatorics is that of words. An
        alphabet is a set $[n]$, and we wish to study the number
        of words of length $k$ in $[n]$. Binary words are words
        when the alphabet is $\{0,1\}$. There are also words
        with a prescribed number for each letter.
        There are also circular arrangements of the elemnts
        in $[n]$, and the idea of multi-sets. Multi-sets
        are sets that allow for repetition. From elementary
        set theory, we have:
        \begin{equation}
            \{a,b,c\}=\{a,a,b,c\}
        \end{equation}
        Sets are uniquely defined by the elements they contain.
        Multi-sets allow for repetition, and this distringuishes
        two different sets. We write:
        \begin{equation}
            A=\{\{1,1,1,2,3,3\}\}
        \end{equation}
        Note that $A\ne\{\{1,2,3\}\}$. The multiplicty of
        an elements $a\in{A}$ is the number of times the
        element $a$ occurs in the multi-set $A$. To know how
        many multi-sets chosen from $[n]$ with $k$ elements,
        we wish to study the following equation:
        \begin{equation}
            \sum_{i=1}^{n}m_{i}=k
        \end{equation}
        Where $m_{i}$ is the multiplicity of the $i^{th}$
        element of $[n]$. Where wish to find integer solutions
        to this equation, in particular solutions with
        non-negative integers. We can also place restrictions
        on the multi-sets, for example by requiring that
        each element occurs at least once. Thus we'd have:
        \begin{equation}
            \sum_{i=1}^{n}m_{i}=k
            \quad\quad
            m_{i}\geq{1}
        \end{equation}
        A partition of $[n]$ is a collection of sets
        $B_{1},b_{2},\dots,B_{k}$ such that:
        \begin{equation}
            \cup_{i=1}^{k}B_{i}=[n]
            \quad\quad
            B_{i}\cap{B}_{j}=\emptyset
            \quad{i}\ne{j}
        \end{equation}
        The $B_{i}$ are called \textrm{blocks}. We also
        study partitions of numbers. Given $n\geq{0}$, we
        want $\lambda=(\lambda_{1},\dots,\lambda_{\ell})$ such
        that:
        \begin{equation}
            \lambda_{i+1}\leq\lambda_{i},
            \quad\quad
            i=1,2,\dots,\ell-1
        \end{equation}
        And such that:
        \begin{equation}
            \sum_{i=1}{\ell}\lambda_{i}=n
        \end{equation}
        Another commonly studied object is a graph. Labelled
        tress, colorings of graphs, and spanning trees. Finally
        we study tableaux's. These are fillings of arrays
        of boxes with objects, such as numbers, sets, and
        multi-sets.
    \section{Counting Techniques}
        \subsection{Basic Numbers}
            \begin{equation}
                n^{k}=\big|\{f:[k]\rightarrow[n]\}\big|=
                \textrm{The number of words over the alphabet }
                [n]
            \end{equation}
            \begin{equation}
                \binom{n}{k}=
                \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}=
                \textrm{The number of ways to choose }k
                \textrm{ objects from }[n]
            \end{equation}
            Stirling's number of the second kind, denoted
            $S(k,n)$, is the number of ways to partition
            $[n]$ into $n$ blocks. $P(n)$ is the number of
            partitions of the integer $n$. And lastly,
            $n!$ is the number of bijections from $[n]$ into
            $[n]$. That is, $n!$ is the number of permutations
            on $[n]$.
        \subsection{Basic Counting Principles}
            Sum Rule (Divide and Conquer): If you cannot
            count the set, divide it into pieces and count
            the pieces.
            \begin{align}
                S&=\bigcup_{i=1}^{k}S_{i}
                \quad\quad
                S_{i}\cap{S}_{j}=\emptyset,
                \quad{i}\ne{j}\\
                |S|&=\sum_{i=1}^{k}|S_{i}|
            \end{align}
            Application: Classify or partition the elements
            in $S$ according to a set of mutually disjoint
            properties $p_{1},\dots,p_{k}$ and let:
            \begin{equation}
                S_{k}=\{x\subseteq{S}:p_{k}(x)\}
            \end{equation}
            We often use such a scheme to prove recurrences.
            For example Pascal's triangle:
            \begin{equation}
                \binom{n}{k}=
                \binom{n-1}{k-1}+\binom{n-1}{k}
            \end{equation}
            We can prove this by plugging in the formula and
            simplifying, but we wish to give a combinatorial
            proof. Let $S\subseteq[n]$, where
            $\Card(S)=k\leq{n}$. Define:
            \begin{align}
                S_{1}&=\{A\subseteq{S}:n\in{A}\}\\
                S_{2}=\{A\subseteq{S}:n\notin{A}\}
            \end{align}
            Then $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ partition $S$, and thus
            $\Card(S)=\Card(S_{1})+\Card(S_{2})$. But:
            \begin{align}
                \Card(S_{1})&=\binom{n-1}{k-1}\\
                \Card(S_{2})&=\binom{n-1}{k}
            \end{align}
            This completes the proof. Next is the difference
            rule (Count the opposite):
            \begin{align}
                S&\subseteq\mathcal{U}\\
                \overline{S}&=\mathcal{U}\setminus{S}\\
                \Card(S)&=\Card(\mathcal{U})
                    -\Card(\overline{S})
            \end{align}
            For example, how many permutations on $[n]$ are
            there so that 1 and 2 are not next to each other?
            We count 1 and 2 being together as 12 or 21.
            It's thus easier to think of this as one element.
            So we're counting the number of permutation on
            $[n-1]$ by consider $12$ as one element, and
            again by consider $21$ as one element. This
            gives $2(n-1)!$. By taking the difference, we
            have:
            \begin{equation}
                \Card(S)=n!-2(n-1)!=(n-1)!(n-2)
            \end{equation}
    \section{Posets}
        Let $n\in\mathbb{N}$, $X=2^{[n]}=\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{Z}_{n})$, and
        let consider $(X,\subseteq)$, where $\subseteq$ is the partial ordering
        of inclusion. If $\Card(A)=\Card(B)$, then either $A=B$, or
        $A$ and $B$ are not comparable, and hence $\subseteq$ is a partial
        order.
        \begin{theorem}
            For any $n\geq{1}$, $2^{[n]}$ has a SCD.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            Let $x\in{2}^{[n]}$. Then $x$ has a binary representation. We
            want to create 1-0 pairs as if they were parentheses. For example,
            suppse $x=\{1,5,7\}$. Then $x=0110001$. We match this up to
            $)(()))(\leftrightarrow0(())01$. To get the chain containing
            $x$, we need to describe how to go up and how to go down
            in the chain. To go up, take the right-most unpaired zero
            and change it to a one. To go down, take the left-most one
            and change it to a zero. For the example of $x=\{1,5,6\}$, we have:
            \begin{equation*}
                0110000\rightarrow0110001\rightarrow0110011\rightarrow1110011
            \end{equation*}
            The size of the smallest set in the chain the the number of
            parenthesizations. If this number is $i$, then the largest set
            has size $(n-2i)+i=n-i$. By construction, the chain is saturated.
            At every step we only add one element. Thus, the constructions
            produce symmetric chains. Notice that we never produce new
            1-0 pairings in the algorithm. Thus, all of the sets in the chain
            have the same pairings. So two sets $X$ and $Y$ produce either
            the same chain or disjoint chains. For example, consider
            $2^{[4]}$. The chain is:
            \begin{align*}
                0000\rightarrow0001\rightarrow
                0011\rightarrow0111\rightarrow1111\\
                0010\rightarrow0110\rightarrow1110\\
                0100\rightarrow0101\rightarrow1101\\
                1000\rightarrow1001\rightarrow1011
            \end{align*}
        \end{proof}
        \begin{ltheorem}{Sperner's Theorem}
            Any anti-chain of $2^{[n]}$ elements has at most
            $\binom{n}{\floor{n/2}}$ subsets.
        \end{ltheorem}
        \begin{proof}
            Notice that in the diagram of $2^{[n]}$ each level contains
            $\binom{n}{k}$ elements. An SCD partitions $2^{[n]}$. Let
            $G$ be an $SCD$. with $m$ chains. Then the maximum number of
            incomparable elements is $m$. therwise, two imcomparable elements
            are in the same chain. Thus, $m\geq\binom{n}{\floor{n/2}}$. Also,
            each chain will intersect a level in the graph of the poset at most
            once. Therefore, $m\leq\binom{n}{\floor{n/2}}$. Thus, etc.
        \end{proof}
        The existence of a symmetric chain decomposition gives an elegant
        combinatorial proof that the sequence
        $\binom{n}{k}$, $k=0,1,\dots,n$, is unimodal. To prove unimodality, it
        would suffice to show that, for $k\leq{n/2}$, there exists an
        injection from $k$ subsets to $k+1$ subsets. If we have a SCD, map
        a $k$ subset to it's successor in the chain. This gives the injection.
    \section{Binomial Coefficients and Multi-Sets}
        Recall that a multi-set is similar to a set, except that repetitions
        are allowed. For example, if we consider $[3]$, then a multi-set of
        of this could be:
        \begin{equation}
            \{\{1,1,2,2,3\}\}
        \end{equation}
        This has 5 elements, and is a mutli-set of size 5.
        \begin{theorem}
            The number of $k$ multisets of an $n$ element set is:
            \begin{equation}
                \frac{n^{\overline{k}}}{k!}
                =\frac{n(n+1)\cdots(n+k-1)}{k!}
                =\binom{n+k-1}{k}
            \end{equation}
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            For let $S$ be the set of multi-sets of size $k$ of elements
            of an $n$ element set, and let $T$ be subsets of size $k$ in
            $[n+k-1]$. We need to produce a map $f:S\rightarrow[T]$. Let:
            \begin{equation}
                M=\{\{1\leq{a}_{1}\leq{a}_{2}\leq\cdots\leq{a}_{k}\leq{n}\}\}
            \end{equation}
            This maps to the set:
            \begin{equation}
                A=\{1\leq{a}_{1}<a_{2}+1<a_{3}+2<\cdots<a_{k}+k-1\leq{n}+k-1\}
            \end{equation}
            This mapping is reversible. Therefore, etc.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{example}
            Let $n=3$, and $k=5$. Also, define:
            \begin{equation}
                M=\{\{1,1,2,2,3\}\}
            \end{equation}
            Then:
            \begin{equation}
                A=\{1,2,4,5,7\}\subseteq[7]
            \end{equation}
        \end{example}
        Multi-sets can be seen as binary sequences (Stars and bars). For
        example, let $M=\{3,3,4,7,7\}$. We can write this as
        $||**|*|||**$. This helps count out the repetitions of various elements
        in the multi-set. $\binom{n}{k}$ can be seen as the number of
        functions that map $k$ elements to $0$ and $n-k$ elements to $1$.
        We can generalize to functions $[n]\rightarrow[m]$. Let
        $k_{1},k_{2},\dots,x_{m}$ be such that:
        \begin{equation}
            \sum_{i=1}^{m}k_{i}=n
        \end{equation}
        And such that, for all $i$, $k_{i}\geq{0}$. Then
        $\binom{n}{k_{1},\dots,k_{m}}$ is the number of ways to map
        $[n]\rightarrow[m]$ such that $k_{i}$ elements map to $i$, where:
        \begin{align}
            \binom{n}{k_{1},k_{2},\dots,k_{m}}&=
            \binom{n}{k_{1}}\binom{n-k_{1}}{k_{2}}
            \binom{n-k_{1}-k_{2}}{k_{3}}\cdots\binom{k_{m}}{k_{m}}\\
            &=\frac{n!}{k_{1}!k_{2}!\cdots{k}_{m}!}
        \end{align}
        \begin{ltheorem}{Multinomial Theorem}
            \begin{equation}
                (x_{1}+x_{2}+\cdots+x_{m})^{n}=
                \sum_{k_{1}+\cdots+k_{m}=n}
                \binom{n}{k_{1},\dots,k_{m}}x_{1}^{k_{1}}\cdots{x}_{m}^{k_{m}}
            \end{equation}
        \end{ltheorem}
        \subsection{Lattice Paths}
            Let $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$ be an integer lattice of dimension $d$, where
            $d\in\mathbb{N}$ and $d\geq{1}$.
            \begin{ldefinition}{Lattice Path}
                A lattice path in $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$ with $k$ steps in
                $S\subseteq\mathbb{Z}^{d}$ is a subset
                $L\subseteq\mathbb{Z}^{d}$ such that $L=\{v_{1},\dots,v_{k}\}$
                such that, for all $i=1,2,\dots,k-1$, $v_{i+1}-v_{i}\in{S}$.
            \end{ldefinition}
            \begin{example}
                If $d=2$, $S=\{(0,1),(1,0)\}$, then there are 6 paths
                from $(0,0)$ to $(2,2)$.
            \end{example}
            \begin{theorem}
                if $v=(a_{1},\cdots,a_{d})\in\mathbb{Z}^{d}$ and if $e_{i}$ is
                the $i^{th}$ unit vector in $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$, then the number
                of lattice paths in $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$ from the origin to
                $v$ with steps in $\{e_{i}:i\in\mathbb{d}\}$ is given by
                the multinomial coefficient
                $\binom{\norm{v}_{1}}{a_{1},\dots,a_{d}}$.
            \end{theorem}
            \begin{proof}
                For let $v_{0},\cdots,v_{k}$ be a path. Then
                $v_{1}-v_{0},v_{2}-v_{1},\dots,v_{k}-v_{k-1}$ consist of
                the $e_{i}$. Thus there are $a_{1}$ $e_{1}$'s,
                $a_{2}$ $e_{2}$'s, and so on. The total number is thus the
                multinomial coefficient.
            \end{proof}
            \begin{theorem}
                The number of lattice paths from $(0,0)$ to $(n,m)$ with
                steps in $\{(0,1),(1,0)\}$ is $\binom{n+m}{n}$.
            \end{theorem}
