    \chapter{Finite Groups}
        Finite groups are of fundamental interest not only to mathematicians,
        but throughout many of the other sciences. Indeed, chemists and
        physicists make regular use of the theory of finite groups, and its
        application can be found in general relativity, quantum mechanics, and
        studying the lattice structure of organic molecules. A finite group is
        exactly what it sounds like: A group $(G,*)$ where $G$ is a finite set.
        \begin{fdefinition}{Finite Group}{Finite_Group}
            A finite group is a \gls{group} $(G,*)$ such that $G$ is a
            finite set.
        \end{fdefinition}
        One of the fundamental problems of group theory is a combinatorial one.
        Given an integer $n\in\mathbb{N}$, how many groups with $n$ elements are
        there (up to isomorphism)? This challenging problem can be aided by the
        theorems of Cayley, Cauchy, Lagrange, and Sylow, and it is our aim to
        develop this theory.
