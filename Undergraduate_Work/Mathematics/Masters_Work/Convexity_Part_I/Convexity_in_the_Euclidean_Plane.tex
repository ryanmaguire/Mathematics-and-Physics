        \begin{definition}
        $A(K)$ is the area of a compact set $K$.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{definition}
        The perimeter $P(K)$ is the length of the boundary curve, $\mu(\partial K)$.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{definition}
        The section $X_{\ell}(K)$ is defined for any given straight line $\ell$ to be the length $\mu(K\cap \ell)$.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{definition}
        Given a straight line $\ell$, the width $W_{\ell}(K)$ is $\mu(\ell_{K})$.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{definition}
        The mean width $W(K)$ is the average of the width of all $W_{\ell}(K)$.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{definition}
        The minimum width $w(K)$ is the minimum of $W_{\ell}(K)$ over all possible directions of the line $\ell$.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{definition}
        The maximum width $\check{W}$ is the maximum of $W_{\ell}(K)$.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{definition}
        The diameter $D(K)$ is the maximum distance between any two points inside $K$.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{definition}
        The inradius $r_K$ is the maximum radius of any circle inside $K$.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{definition}
        The circumradius $R_K$ is the minimum radius of any circle containing $K$.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{notation}
        For bounded sets $K\subset \mathbb{R}^2$, define $R_K(\theta)$ as the projection or $K$ onto the line $\sin(\theta)y=\cos(\theta)x$.
        \end{notation}
        \begin{theorem}
        If $K$ is a compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$, then there are points $x,y\in K$ such that $d(x,y)=D(K)$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
        As $K$ is compact, it is bounded. Let $M$ be such a bound. Then the set $D=\{r\in \mathbb{R}^+| d(x,y) = r,\ x,y\in K\}$ is bounded by $M$. Let $d$ be the least upper bound of this set. Then we can find a sequence of points $x_n,y_n\in K$ such that $d(x_n,y_n) \rightarrow d$. As $K$ is compact, there are convergent subsequence $x_{n_k}$ and $y_{n_k}$ with limits in $K$, call them $x$ and $y$. Then $d(x,y) = d$. Thus, there are points $x,y\in K$ such that $d(x,y) \geq d(a,b)$ for all $a,b\in K$. Therefore $D(K)$ is equal to $d$.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
        There exist bounded sets $K$ such that $R_K(\theta)$ is not continuous.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
        For define $\mathcal{M} = \{(x,y)\in [-1,1]^2: x\in \mathbb{Q},y\in \mathbb{R}\}$, and let $\mathcal{N} = \{(x,y)\in \mathbb{R}^2: x^2+y^2\leq 1\}$, and consider $K = \mathcal{M}\cap \mathcal{N}$. $f_{K}(\theta)$ is discontinuous at $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}$. For, $f_K(\frac{\pi}{2}) = \mu(\mathbb{Q}\cap [-1,1])=0$. But, for any $0<\delta < \pi$, $f_K(\frac{\pi}{2}\pm\delta) = 2$. Thus, $f_K(\theta) = \begin{cases} 0, & \theta = \pm \frac{\pi}{2} \\ 2, & \theta \ne \pm \frac{\pi}{2}\end{cases}$. In the image below, the length of $R_K(\frac{\pi}{2}-\delta)$ is the length of the line $\overline{AB}$, which is 2.
        \end{proof}

        \begin{theorem}
        If $K\subset \mathbb{R}^2$ is compact and convex, then $R_K(\theta)$ is continuous.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
        For let $K$ be compact and convex, and without loss of generality suppose it contained within the unit disc and contains the origin. Let $\theta\in (0,2\pi)$ be given and let $\ell_{\theta}$ be a line through the origin making an angle $\theta$ with the horizontal. Let $x=(x_1,x_2),y=(y_1,y_2)\in K$ be such that $W_{\ell_{\theta}}(K) = d(x,y)$. Such points exist as $K$ is compact. Let $\varepsilon>0$ be given. About $x$, consider $B_{\frac{\varepsilon}{2}}(x)$, and similarly $B_{\frac{\varepsilon}{2}}(y)$. Neither of these are empty, as $K$ is convex. Let $x',y'\in K\cap(B_{\frac{\varepsilon}{2}}(x)\cup B_{\frac{\varepsilon}{2}}(y))$ be such that $d(x',y')$ is maximized. As this set is compact, such points exist. Let $\delta = \min\{|\theta-\frac{x_2'}{\sqrt{x_1'^2+x_2'^2}}|,|\theta-\frac{y_2'}{\sqrt{y_1'^2+y_2'^2}}|\}$. Then for $|\theta-\theta_0|<\delta$, $d(x,y)-\varepsilon \leq W_{\ell_{\theta_0}}(K)\leq d(x,y)+\varepsilon$, and thus $|W_{\ell_\theta}(K)-W_{\ell_{\theta_0}}(K)| < \varepsilon$.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{lemma}
        If $K$ is a compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $x,y\in K$ such that $d(x,y)=D(K)$, then the lines perpendicular to $\overline{xy}$ at $x$ and $y$ contain all of $K$ in between.
        \end{lemma}
        \begin{proof}
        Suppose not. Let $\overline{X}$ be the line perpendicular to $\overline{xy}$ containing point $x$, and similarly define $\overline{Y}$. Suppose there is a point $z\in K$ that falls on the exterior of the region $\mathcal{U} = \{(x,y)\in \mathbb{R}^2: (x,y)\ \textrm{Lies Between } \overline{X}\ \textrm{and } \overline{Y}\}$. Note that $d(x,z)\ne d(y,z)$, as then $z$ would line between these two lines. Suppose $d(y,z)<d(x,z)$. Where the line $\overline{xz}$ cuts $\overline{Y}$ denote as $A$. But then $d(x,z) > d(x,A) = \sqrt{d(y,A)^2+d(x,y)^2}\geq d(x,y)$. A contradiction as $d(x,y) = D(K)$. Thus $z\in \mathcal{U}$.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
        If $K\subset \mathbb{R}^2$ is compact and convex, then there are points $x,y\in K$ such that $\check{W}(K)=d(x,y)$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
        As $f_K(\theta)$ is continuous for convex compact set, and as it is continuous on a compact set $[0,2\pi]$, it attains its maximum. Let $\theta$ be such a maximum. Let $\ell_{\theta}$ be the line through the origin which makes an angle $\theta$ with the horizontal axis and consider set $K_{\ell_{\theta}}$. As $K$ is compact and $\ell_{\theta}$ is closed, $K_{\ell_{\theta}}$ is compact. Then $W=\{d(x,y):x,y\in K_{\ell_{\theta}}\}$ is bounded, has a least upper bound, and therefore there are points $x,y \in K$ such that $\check{W}(K)=d(x,y)$.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
        If $K$ is a compact convex set of $\mathbb{R}^2$, then $D(K) = \check{W}(K)$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
        As $K$ is compact, $D(K)$ and $\check{W}(K)$ exists and there are points $x,y$ such that $d(x,y) = D(K)$ and points $x',y'$ such that $d(x',y') = \check{W}(K)$. Suppose $d(x',y')> d(x,y)$. A contradiction, as $d(x,y)$ is the diameter of $K$. So $d(x,y) \geq d(x',y')$. Now suppose $d(x,y)>d(x',y')$. But as $d(x',y')= \check{W}(K)$, $d(x',y')$ is the greatest length of any line segment that terminates in $K$ and such that perpendiculars at these terminating points contain all of $K$. But as $d(x,y)=D(K)$, the lines perpendicular to $\overline{xy}$ at $x$ and $y$ contain all of $K$, a contradiction. Thus $d(x',y') \geq d(x,y)$. But it was just showed that $d(x,y)\geq d(x',y')$. Thus, $d(x,y) = d(x',y')$. $D(K) = \check{W}(K)$.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{definition}
        If $Q$ is a convex polygon with interior (That is, positive area) in $\mathbb{R}^2$, then the perimeter of $Q$ is the sum of the lengths of its edges. 
        \end{definition}
        \begin{definition}
        The perimeter of a line segment $e$ is $P(e) = 2|e|$.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{remark}
        This is for the sake of continuity. If we take a rectangle of length $|e|$ and width $\frac{1}{n}$, then the perimeter is $2|e|+\frac{2}{n} \rightarrow 2|e|$ as $n\rightarrow \infty$. Thus, for the puprose of continuity we define the perimeter of line segments to be twice their length.
        \end{remark}
        \begin{theorem}[Cauchy's Perimeter Theorem]
        If $K$ is a compact convex subset of the plane, then $P(K) = \pi W(K)$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
        Suppose that $Q$ is a convex polygon with edges $e_1,\hdots, e_n$. At each $e_i$, let $\theta_i$ be the angle made with $e_i$ and the horizontal axis of $\mathbb{R}^2$. The mean width is $W(Q) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi} W_{\ell_\theta}(Q)d\theta = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{0}^{2\pi} \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{n} |e_i||\cos(\theta-\theta_i)|d\theta = \frac{1}{4\pi}\sum_{i=1}^{n} |e_i|\int_{0}^{2\pi} |\cos(\theta-\theta_i)|d\theta = \frac{1}{\pi} \sum_{i=1}^{n} |e_i| = \frac{1}{\pi} P(Q)$. Thus, $P(Q) = \pi W(Q)$. For any convex compact subset $K\subset \mathbb{R}^2$, we may find a polygon $Q$ that approximates the boundary with a perimeter $P(Q)$ that is as close to $P(K)$ and a width $W(Q)$ as close to $W(K)$ as desired. That is, for all $n\in \mathbb{N}$, we can obtain a polynomial $Q_n$ such that $\max\{|W(Q_n)-W(K)|,|P(K)-P(Q_n)|\}< \frac{1}{n}$. Then $|P(K)-\pi W(K)| = |P(K) - P(Q_n)+P(Q_n)-\pi W(Q_n)+\pi W(Q_n)-\pi W(K)| \leq |P(K)-P(Q_n)|+|P(Q_n)-\pi W(Q_n)|+\pi|W(Q_n)-W(K)| < \frac{1}{n} + 0 + \frac{\pi}{n} = \frac{1+\pi}{n} \rightarrow 0$. Thus, $P(K) = \pi W(K)$ for arbitrary convex compact subsets of the plane.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
        There exist compact path-connected sets $K\subset \mathbb{R}^2$ such that $P(K) \ne \pi W(K)$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
        Consider the set $K = \{(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2: x^2+y^2=1, y\geq 0\}$. Then $P(K) = 2\pi$, but \\ $W(K) = \pi(\pi+2)$. To see this, consider the set $\mathcal{K} = \{(x,y)\in \mathbb{R}^2: x^2 + y^2 \leq 1, y\geq 0\}$. This is convex and has perimeter $\pi+2$ and therefore $W(\mathcal{K}) = \pi(\pi+2)$. But, as the image shows, $W(K) = W(\mathcal{K})$. That is, $W_{\ell_{\theta}}(K)$ is the length of the line segment $\overline{AB}$, as is $W_{\ell_{\theta}}(\mathcal{K})$. Therefore the averages $W(K)$ and $W(\mathcal{K})$ are the same. Thus, $P(K) \ne \pi W(K)$.
        \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{semicircle-1.png}
        \end{proof}
        \begin{definition}
        A functional $f$ with respect to subset inclusion is said to be monotonic on a family of sets $\mathscr{P}$ if and only if $f(K)\leq f(L)$ for all $K,L \in \mathscr{P}$ such that $K\subset L$.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{theorem}
        If $K\subset L \in \mathscr{K}_2$, then $W_{\ell}(K) \leq W_{\ell}(L)$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
        For let $\pi_{\ell}:\mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \ell$ be the orthogonal projection map of $\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\ell$. Then $\pi_{\ell}(K)\leq \pi_{\ell}(L)$ as $K\subset L$, and thus $W_{\ell}(K)\leq W_{\ell}(L)$.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
        If $K\subset L\in \mathscr{K}_2$, then $W(K)\leq W(L)$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
        For $W_{\ell}(K)\leq W_{\ell}(L)$, and thus $W(K)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}W_{\ell_{\theta}}(K)d\theta \leq \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}W_{\ell_{\theta}}(L)d\theta=W(L)$.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
        If $K\subset L\in \mathscr{K}_2$, then $X_{\ell}(K)\leq X_{\ell}(L)$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
        For if $x\in \ell\cap K$, then $x\in \ell\cap L$, and thus $X_{\ell}(K)=\mu(\ell\cap K) \leq \mu(\ell\cap L)=X_{\ell}(L)$.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
        If $K\subset L\subset \mathscr{K}_2$, then $D(K)\leq D(L)$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
        For suppose not. Suppose $D(K)>D(L)$. Then, there are points $x,y\in K$ such that $d(x,y)> \sup\{d(x',y'):x',y'\in L\}$. But as $K\subset L$, $x,y\in L$ and thus $d(x,y) \not> \sup\{d(x',y'):x',y'\in L\}$. Thus, $D(K)\leq D(L)$.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
        If $K\subset L \subset \mathscr{K}_2$, then $R_K\leq R_L$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
        For suppose not. Suppose $R_K>R_L$. But as $K\subset L$, either this circle contains all of $L$ as well or it doesn't. But then $R_L \not<R_K$. Thus, $R_L\geq R_K$.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
        If $K\subset L \in \mathscr{K}_2$, then $r_K \leq r_L$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
        For suppose not. Suppose $r_K> r_L$. But as the inscribed circle of radius $r_K$ fits entirely in $K$, and $K\subset L$, then it fits inside of $L$. But then $r_K \not > r_L$. Thus, $r_L \geq r_K$.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
        If $K,L\in \mathscr{K}_2$ and $K\subset L$, then $P(K)\leq P(L)$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
        As $K\subset L\in  \mathscr{K}_2$, $W(K)\leq W(L)$. As $K$ and $L$ are convex, $P(K)=\pi W(K)$ and $P(L)=\pi W(L)$. Thus, $P(K) \leq \pi W(L) = P(L)$. Therefore, $P(K)\leq P(L)$.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
        There exists sets $K,L\subset \mathbb{R}^2$ such that $L$ is convex, $K\subset L$, yet $P(K)>P(L)$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
        For let $L = \{(x,y)\in \mathbb{R}^2: x^2 + y^2 \leq 1\}$. Then $P(L) = 2\pi$. Let $K = \{(x,y)\in \mathbb{R}^2: -\sqrt{2}x\leq y \leq \sqrt{2}x,\frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \leq x \leq \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \lor \sqrt{2}x\leq y \leq -\sqrt{2}x,\frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \leq x \leq \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \}$. $P(K) = 4(1+ \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}) \approx 7.26>2\pi$.
        \end{proof}

        \begin{theorem}
        There exist compact convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^2$ such that $D(K) < 2R_K$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
        For consider the set $K=\{(x,y)\in \mathbb{R}^2: [0\leq y\leq x+1 \land x\geq 0]\lor [0\leq y\leq -10x+1\land x\geq 0]\}$. From Euclid, the smallest circle containing this triangle is the one defined by the three vertices (Three points define a triangle). This circle has the formula $(x+0.45)^2+(y-0.45)^2 = (0.45)^2 +(0.45+\frac{1}{10})^2$. Thus, $2R_K = \sqrt{0.45^2 +(0.45+\frac{1}{10})^2} > \sqrt{2} = D(K)$.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
        If $K$ is a compact convex set in $\mathbb{R}^2$, then $D(K) \leq 2R_K$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
        For suppose not. Suppose $D(K) > 2R_K$. As $K$ is compact, there are points $x$ and $y$ in $K$ such that $d(x,y)=D(K)$. But then $d(x,y)>2R_K$, and thus at least one of $x$ or $y$ is not contained in the circle. A contradiction. Thus $D(K)\leq 2R_K$.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
        If $K$ is a compact convex set in $\mathbb{R}^2$, then $2\pi r_K \leq P(K)$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
        From Calculus of Variations we know that the circle maximizes the area contained with a set of perimeter $p$. As the inscribed circle has perimeter $2\pi r_K$ and as the circle is a subset of $K$, it is true that $A(K)$ is greater than or equal the area of the circle. Thus, $P(K)\geq 2\pi r_K$.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
        For a compact convex set of $\mathbb{R}^2$, $P(K) \leq 2\pi R_K$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
        As $K$ is convex, $P(K) = \pi W(K) \leq \pi \check{W}(K) = \pi D(K) \leq 2\pi R_K$.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
        If $K$ is a compact and convex subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$, then $2D(K)\leq P(K)$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
        Suppose not. Suppose $2D(K) >P(K)$. As $K$ is compact and convex, there exist points $x,y\in K$ such that $d(x,y) = D(K)$. But as $K$ is convex, the line contained between $x,y$ in contained in $K$. Thus, $P(\overline{xy}) = 2D(K)$. But as $\overline{xy}\subset K$, $P(K)>P(\overline{xy})$, a contradiction. Thus, $2D(K) \leq P(K)$.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
        There exist compact convex subsets of $\mathbb{R}^2$ such that $2D(K) = P(K)$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
        For take a straight line segment of length $\ell$. Then $D(K) = \ell$, $P(K) = 2\ell$, and thus $2D(K) = P(K)$.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
        If $K$ is a compact convex subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$, then $P(K) \leq \pi D(K)$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
        From Cauchy's Perimeter theorem, $P(K) = \pi W(K) \leq \pi \check{W}(K) = \pi D(K)$.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
        For a compact convex subset $K$ of $\mathbb{R}^2$, $P(K) = \pi D(K)$ if and only if $W_{\ell}(K)$ is a constant.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
        For then $\frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{0}^{2\pi} W_{\ell_{\theta}}(K) d\theta = \check{W}(K)$. But as $W_{\ell_{\theta}}(K)$ is continuous for compact convex bodies, it must be true that $W_{\ell_{\theta}}(K) = \check{W}(K)$ for all $\ell_{\theta}$. Thus, $K$ is of constant width.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{remark}
        There are many types of shapes that have constant width besides discs. The Reuleaux Triangle is such an example.

        Triangles are the simplest convex bodies in the plane other than points and lines. Any convex polygon can be written as the union of triangles with disjoint interiors. 
        \begin{theorem}
        If $\Delta_s$ is an equilateral triangle with edge length $s$, then $\Delta_s$ has the following properties:
        \begin{enumerate}
        \begin{multicols}{5}
        \item $A(\Delta_s) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}s^2$
        \item $P(\Delta_s) = 3s$
        \item $W(\Delta_s) = \frac{3s}{\pi}$
        \item $R_{\Delta_s} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}s$
        \item $r_{\Delta_s} = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}}s$
        \end{multicols}
        \end{enumerate}
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
        In order:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item From Pythagoras, $A(\Delta_s) =2\times\big[\frac{1}{2}(\frac{1}{2}s)(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s)\big] = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}s^2$
            \item There are three edges, each of length $s$, and thus $P(\Delta_s) = 3s$.
            \item $W(\Delta_s) = \frac{1}{\pi}P(\Delta_s) = \frac{3s}{\pi}$
            \item The circumcircle gives the following equations:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item $R_{\Delta_s}^2=\frac{s^2}{4}+h^2$
                \item $h+R_{\Delta_s} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s$
            \end{enumerate}
            This has solution $R_{\Delta_s}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}s$
            \item $r_{\Delta_s} = \frac{R_{\Delta_s}}{2}= \frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}}s$
        \end{enumerate}
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
        If $T$ is a triangle in the plane, then there is a linear transformation $\psi$ such that $\psi T$ is equilateral.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
        For let $T$ be a triangle with vertices $a=(x_1,y_1)$, $b=(x_2,y_2)$, $c=(x_3,y_3)$. Let $A = d(b,c)$, $B=d(a,c)$, and $C=d(a,b)$. Suppose If $A=B=C$, we are done. Thus, suppose $C\geq B >A$. At point $a$ and with radius $C$, construct the circle $b,c',d$, and point $b$ and with radius $C$, construct the circle $a,c',e$. If we can shift $c$ to $c'$ in a linear fashion, we are done. Let $\psi =$
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
        If $T$ is a triangle with edges $a,b,c$ and opposite angles $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$, respectively, then $A(T) = \frac{\sin(\alpha)}{2}bc = \frac{\sin(\beta)}{2}ac = \frac{\sin(\gamma)}{2}ab$
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
        Suppose the triangle is acute. The proof is symmetric for all sides, so we prove it for just $\alpha$. Note that the perpendicular $h$ dropped from the vertex of $a$ onto $b$ satisfies $h^2+\ell_1^2 = c^2$ and $h^2+\ell_2^2 = a^2$, where $\ell_1+\ell_2 = b$. Then $\sin(\alpha) = \frac{h}{c}$ and $A(T) = \frac{1}{2}h\ell_1 + \frac{h}{2}h\ell_2 = \frac{h}{2}(\ell_1+\ell_2)h = \frac{1}{2}bh = \frac{1}{2}bc\sin(\alpha)$. An identical argument works for obtuse triangles.

        \end{proof}
        \begin{corollary}[The Law of Sines]
        For a triangle with edges $a,b,c$ and opposite angles $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$, $\frac{\sin(\alpha)}{a} = \frac{\sin(\beta)}{b} = \frac{\sin(\gamma)}{c}$
        \end{corollary}
        \begin{proof}
        From the previous theorem, divide by $\frac{abc}{2}$ to obtain the result.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}[The Law of Cosines]
        Given a triangle with lengths $a,b,c$ and opposite edges $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$, $c^2=a^2+b^2-2ab\cos(\gamma)$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
        If $\gamma=\frac{\pi}{2}$, this is Pythagoras' Theorem. Thus, suppose $0<\gamma < \frac{\pi}{2}$. Where $c$ and $a$ meet, drop a perpendicular onto $c$ and call this $h$. $h$ satisfies $h^2+\ell_1^2 = c^2$ and $h^2+\ell_2^2=a^2$ from Pythagoras' Theorem, where $\ell_1+\ell_2 = b$. But $\ell_2 = a\cos(\gamma)$, so $\ell_1 = b-a\cos(\gamma)$. Thus $c^2 = h^2 + b^2 +a^2\cos^2(\gamma)-2ab\cos(\gamma)$. But $h = a\sin(\gamma)$. Thus, $c^2 = b^2 + a^2 \cos^2(\gamma)+\sin^2(\gamma)-2ab\cos(\gamma) = b^2 + a^2(\sin^2(\gamma)+\cos^2(\gamma))-2ab\cos(\gamma) = a^2 + b^2 -2ab\cos(\gamma)$. A similar construction is done if $\frac{\pi}{2}<\gamma < \pi$.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
        Given a triangle $\Delta$ with lengths $a\leq b\leq c$, $D(\Delta)=c$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
        At the midpoint of $c$, and with radius $c$, construct a circle. This circle contains the entirety of $\Delta$, and thus for all points $x,y\in \Delta$, $d(x,y)\leq c$. Thus, $c=D(\Delta)$.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}[Heron's Formula]
        For a triangle with lengths $a,b,c>0$, $A(T)^2 = \frac{1}{16}(a+b+c)(-a+b+c)(a-b+c)(a+b-c)$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
        For $A(T) = \frac{1}{2}ab \sin(\gamma) = \frac{1}{2}ab\sqrt{1-\cos^2(\gamma)} = \frac{1}{4}\sqrt{4a^2 b^2 - (a+b-c)^2}=\\ \frac{1}{4}\sqrt{(2ab-(a^2+b^2-c^2))(2ab+(a^2+b^2+c^2))} = \frac{1}{4}\sqrt{(c^2-(a-b)^2)((a+b)^2-c^2)} = \\ \frac{1}{4}\sqrt{(a+b+c)(-a+b+c)(a-b+c)(a+b-c)}$. Squaring this gives the result.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
        For any triangle $\Delta$, $r_{\Delta}P(\Delta) = 2A(\Delta)$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
        For let $\Delta$ has sides $a,b,c$, with opposite angles $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$, respectively. Then $A(\Delta) = \frac{ab}{2}\sin(\gamma)$ and $P(\Delta)=a+b+c$. Thus, $\frac{2A(\Delta)}{P(\Delta)} = \frac{ab\sin(\gamma)}{a+b+c}$. But this is the radius of the incircle of $\Delta$. Therefore, etc.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}[Viviani's Theorem: Page 17]
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{theorem}
        There exist convex polygon's such that the inradius is not unique.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
        For consider the rectangle $[0,2]\times [0,1]$. The diameter of any circle that sits inside this body must be at most $1$, and thus the radius is at most $\frac{1}{2}$. However, there are multiple circles that achieve this. For example $(x-\frac{1}{2})^2+(y-\frac{1}{2})^2=\frac{1}{2}$ and $(x-\frac{3}{2})^2+(y-\frac{3}{2})^2=\frac{1}{2}$.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
        For an acute triangle, $\frac{2(A)}{abc} = \frac{1}{R_T}$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{theorem}
        If $\Delta$ is a triangle with vertices $A,B,C$ and sides $a,b,c$, then given a circle that contains $A,B,C$, the radius of this circle $R$ satisfies $\frac{1}{R} =\frac{2A(\Delta)}{abc}$
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{definition}
        If $K\in \mathscr{K}_2$, then $-K = \{-x:x\in K\}$.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{theorem}
        If $K\in \mathscr{K}_2$, then $W_{\ell}(K) = W_{\ell}(-K)$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
        For let $x,y\in K$ be such that $d(x,y) = W_{\ell}(K)$. Then $d(-x,-y) = W_{\ell}(-K) = d(x,y)$. Therefore, etc.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
        There exist sets $K$ and $L$ such that $W_{\ell}(K)<W_{\ell}(L)$ for all $\ell$ yet $K\not\subset L$ for any translation or rotation of $K$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{definition}
        For $K\in \mathscr{K}$ and unit vector $u$, $\bar{X}_{u}(K)$ is the mean value of $X_{\ell}(K)$ over all lines $\ell$ parallel to $u$ such that $X_{\ell}(K)>0$.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{theorem}
        For $K\in \mathscr{K}_2$, $\bar{X}_{u}(K) = W_{\ell}(K)=A(K)$.
