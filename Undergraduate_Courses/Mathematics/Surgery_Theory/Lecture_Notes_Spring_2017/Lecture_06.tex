    \subsection{Lecture 6: The Brown Representation Theorem}
        A functor $f:\textrm{Spaces}\rightarrow\textrm{Groups}$
        takes a topological space and returns a group. There are
        many examples, such as homology, cohomoloy, and K-Theory.
        Under certain circumstances there is a space
        $B_{\circ{f}}$ such that there is a one-to-one functor
        $f(\mathcal{M})\leftrightarrow[\mathcal{M},B_{\circ{f}}]$,
        where $\mathcal{M}$ is a manifold.
        \begin{example}
            Let $G$ be a group, and $X\in{K}(G,n)$ an
            Eilenberg-MacLane space. This is not usually a
            manifold, but may be a complex, for example.
            As $X\in{K}(G,n)$, we have that
            $\pi_{n}(X)=G$ and, for all $m\ne{n}$,
            $\pi_{m}(X)=0$. THen $K(G,n)$ is the
            $B_{\circ{f}}$, where the $\circ{f}$ is cohomology
            with coefficients in $G$. That is, we have
            $H^{n}(\mathcal{M};G)%
             \leftrightarrow[\mathcal{M},K(G,n)]$
            is a one-to-one mapping.
        \end{example}
        Conside a manifold $\mathcal{M}$ and the semi-group of
        vector bundles $V(\mathcal{M})$ on $\mathcal{M}$
        with $\oplus$ give by the \textit{Whitney Sum}
        (More on that later). The Grothendique construction gives
        us a group $E(\mathcal{M})$ where the elements are vector
        bundles and ``negative,'' vector bundles (Virtual bundels).
        $E$ can then be thought of as a functor from spaces to
        groups: $E:\textrm{Spaces}\rightarrow\textrm{Groups}$.
        There is some sloppiness ahead that will be clarified later.
        There os a space $BO$ such that
        $E(\mathcal{M})\leftrightarrow[\mathcal{M},BO]$
        is a one-to-one mapping. Note that the
        $B_{\circ{f}}$ are classifying spaces. $BO$ is also
        a classifying space. Let $\mathcal{O}(n)$ be the
        set of orthogonal matrices, as defined in a previous
        lecture. $n\times{n}$ matrices such that $A^{T}=A^{-1}$.
        We saw before that there is a natual mapping $\psi_{n}$
        of $\mathcal{O}(n)$ into $\mathcal{O}(n+1)$. We can
        then form the sequence:
        \begin{equation*}
            \mathcal{O}(1)
            \overset{\psi_{1}}{\longrightarrow}
            \mathcal{O}(2)
            \overset{\psi_{2}}{\longrightarrow}
            \mathcal{O}(3)
            \overset{\psi_{3}}{\longrightarrow}
            \mathcal{O}(4)
            \overset{\psi_{4}}{\longrightarrow}
            \cdots
            \mathcal{O}(n)
            \overset{\psi_{n}}{\longrightarrow}
            \cdots
        \end{equation*}
        And define $\mathcal{O}$ to be the
        \textit{direct limit} of this sequence.
        This is a subset of ``infinite'' dimensional
        matrices. Orthogonal matrices act on vector bundles,
        there are ``rotations,'' of the fibers in
        various dimensions. Let $H$ be a vector bundle over
        $\mathcal{M}$. ``Compactify,'' the fibers,
        which are homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, making
        them now homeomorphic to $S^{n}$. This is, in a way,
        adding a point ``at infinity,'' or performing the
        one point compactification of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$.
        An example is the stereographic projection of the
        sphere onto the plane. The compactification of
        this is adding the ``North Pole,'' which was
        previously ignored as it is projected
        ``to infinity.'' The stereographic projection
        gives a bijection
        $f:S^{n}\setminus\{\textrm{North Pole}\}%
         \rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n}$.
        We now have the mapping
        $f:\mathbb{R}^{n}\cup\{\infty\}%
         \rightarrow(S^{n}\setminus\{\textrm{North Pole}\})%
         \cup\{\textrm{North Pole}\}=S^{n}$.
        How to we make $\mathbb{R}^{n}\cup\{\infty\}$ into
        a topological space? If
        $\mathcal{U}$ is open in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, we say
        that it is still open. Moreover, we say that
        $[-\infty,a)=(-\infty,a)\cup\{\infty\}$ and
        $(a,\infty]=(a,\infty)\cup\{\infty\}$ are also
        open sets. The topology on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is
        then the topology generated by the three types
        of sets. Compactifying the fibers of a vector bundle
        creates something called a sphere bundle. An
        example is shown in
        Fig.~\ref{fig:Surgery_Theory_%
                  Compactification_of_Vector_Bundle}.
        \begin{figure}
            \centering
            \captionsetup{type=figure}
            \subimport{../../../../tikz/}
                      {Compactification_of_Vector_Bundle}
            \caption{Turning a Vector Bundle into a Sphere Bundle.}
            \label{fig:Surgery_Theory_%
                   Compactification_of_Vector_Bundle}
        \end{figure}
        A spherical fibration is a space $\mathcal{M}$
        where at each point $x$, the fiber of $x$ is
        equivalent to a sphere $S^{n}$ and all
        \textit{transition maps} are homotopy equivalent,
        rather than homeomorphic. The collection of all
        spherical fibrations on a manifold $\mathcal{M}$
        is a semigroup. The Grothendique group associated
        with this is denoted $S(\mathcal{M})$. This group
        is a classifying space. So we have that a vector
        bundle on $\mathcal{M}$ gives rise to a spherical
        fibration on $\mathcal{M}$.
        \begin{equation*}
            \underset{\textrm{Vector Bundle}}{[\mathcal{M},BO]}
            \longrightarrow
            \underset{\textrm{Spherical Fibration}}{[\mathcal{M},BG]}
        \end{equation*}
        We have the following diagrams to consider:
        \begin{figure}
            \centering
            \captionsetup{type=figure}
            \subimport{../../../../tikz/}
                      {Lifting_Property_Commutative_Diagram}
            \caption{Diagrams for the Lifting Propery}
            \label{fig:Surgery_Theory_Lifting_Property_Diagram}
        \end{figure}
        Given $\varphi$ and $f$, we can form
        $\hat{\varphi}:\mathcal{M}\rightarrow{BO}$ by taking
        the composition, $\hat{\varphi}(x)=(f\circ\varphi)(x)$.
        The lifting problem is, given the central diagram,
        can we find a continuous map
        $\hat{\varphi}:\mathcal{M}\rightarrow{BG}$ such that
        the diagram becomes commutative? The answer is not always.
        The final diagram gives rise to all ``kernels,'' like
        in exactness: $BG/BO\dashrightarrow{BO}\rightarrow{BG}$.
        We thus define $G/O\equiv{BG/BO}$. The homotopy collection
        $[\mathcal{M},G/O]$ ``computes,'' the extent of which a map
        $\psi:\mathcal{M}\rightarrow{B}$ can be ``lifted,'' to
        $\hat{\varphi}:\mathcal{M}\rightarrow{BO}$.
        Loops on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, that is, continuous functions
        $f:S^{1}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n}$, can be
        contracted to a point. To put another way, no loops
        can wrap around ``holes'' in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$.
        Therefore, $[\mathbb{R}^{n},G/O]$ is a point. For
        more examples, we have
        $[S^{1},G/O]=\pi_{1}(G/O)$, and
        $[S^{n},G/P]=\pi_{n}(G/O)$. In our discussions
        $O$ gives rise to a differentiable manifold $BO$.
        We can replace this with piece-wise linear or
        topological and obtain spaces like
        $BPL$ or $BTop$, respectively.
        From the Poincare Conjecture we have that
        $S^{Top}(S^{n})=S^{PL}(S^{n})=\{e\}$. That is,
        the trivial group. Our Surgery Exact Sequence now
        becomes:
        \begin{equation*}
            L_{n+1}(\mathbb{Z}\pi)\rightarrow
            0\rightarrow
            [\Sigma\mathcal{M},G/Top]\rightarrow
            L_{n}(\mathbb{Z}\pi)\rightarrow
            0\rightarrow
            [\mathcal{M},G/Top]\rightarrow
            L_{n-1}(\mathbb{Z}\pi)\rightarrow\cdots
        \end{equation*}
        So $L_{n+1}(\mathbb{Ze}\simeq[S^{n+1},G/Top]%
            =\pi_{n}(G/Top)$,
        therefore $L_{n+1}(G/Top)\simeq{L_{n}(\mathbb{Z}e)}$.
