    \chapter{Elementary Field Theory}
    Fields are logically the next step in adding structure to algebra. Most of
    the problems that arise in ring theory stem from the fact that non-zero
    elements may not be invertible, and also that zero divisors may exist. Field
    theory rids us of these problems and establishes the 9 familiar properties
    of arithmetic that one is familiar with from elementary school. While the
    structure of a field is certainly nice, there can still be some problems
    that may appear when one let's their intuition get in the way (for example,
    in the field $\ring{\mathbb{Z}_{2}}$ we have $1+1=0$).
