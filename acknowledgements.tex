I'd like to thank the many people who have helped me better understand
mathematics and physics over the years. This includes Stanley Chang,
Enrique Gonzalez-Valesco, Tim Cook, James Egan, Richard French, Sam Gomez,
Sam Fingerman, Alexander ``Sasha'' Kheifets, Tibor Beke, Justin Jozokos, and
Mike. A particular thanks must go out to Dan Klain who was both infinitely
patient and helpful throughout the years, and, of course, to James ``Kiwi''
Graham-Eagle who was both a mentor and friend, and whom first showed me how
amazing mathematics truly is. Personal thanks go to Molly, Kyle, Asa, Kaileigh,
and Nayeeb for their years (and decades) of friendship.
