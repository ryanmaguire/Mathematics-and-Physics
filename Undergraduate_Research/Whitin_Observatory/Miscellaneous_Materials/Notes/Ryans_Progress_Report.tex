                              to create Cassini's trajectory.
            \item[2017/07/21] Read through Marouf 1982 to better
                              understand the geometry.
                              Doubtful of certain claims.
            \item[2017/07/21] Read through Marouf 1986 to learn more
                              about diffraction correction.
            \item[2017/07/24] Found error in Marouf 1982. It claims
                              Earth should lie in $xz$ plane,
                              but it should not.
            \item[2017/07/24] Used Glenn's Ripcalc routine to find the
                              ring radius vs. time for Voyager I.
            \item[2017/07/24] Worked on understanding the

                              of using the
                              kernels. Will figure out tomorrow.
            \item[2017/08/02] Learned to use ripcalc.

                              agrees with the
                              Rev-7E results to within a few meters.
            \item[2017/08/04] Changed ripcalc. Voyager results
                              agree with rgf\_MTR86\_table1.pro to a
                              few centimeters.

            \item[2017/08/04] Learned to use the NAIF Toolkit effectively
                              and used in code.

            \item[2017/08/11] Worked on figure 4 of Marouf et al. 1986.
            \item[2017/08/11] Read Chylek's paper to understand the
                              theory behind Fresnel diffraction.
            \item[2017/08/11] Learned about Hanning and Hamming windows.
            \item[2017/08/11] Learned about the limitations
                              of various windows.
            \item[2017/08/11] Learned about Chebyshev and
                              Kaiser-Bessel windows.
            \item[2017/08/11] Read Characteristics of

            \item[2017/08/11] Read through Understanding FFTs
                              and Windowing
            \item[2017/08/11] Learned about windowing/taper functions.
            \item[2017/08/11] Read Chylek.
            \item[2017/08/16] Read Introduction to Matched Filters.

            \item[2017/08/18] Tested various save files:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item input\_rev7E\_avg\_iq\_16khz: Bad reconstruction.
                      Crazy phase. The power reconstruction was squashed
                      down to zero.
                \item input\_rev7E\_avg\_iq\_100m: Bad reconstruction.
                      Jolene's save file that shifts the geometry by 100
                      meters in an attempt to fix offset. Offset comes
                      from phase, not geometry. This is also an old file.
                \item input\_rev7E\_avg\_iq\_halfbin: Bad reconstruction.
                      A different attempt to fix the offset. Old file.
                \item input\_rev7E\_avg\_iq\_predicts: Good reconstruction.
                      Uses reconstructed frequency. Uses kernels from the
                      trajectory of the spacecraft after the event. Still
                      contains slope in the phase, which results in offset.
                \item input\_rev7E\_avg\_iq - Good reconstruction.
                      Gets sky frequency from polynomials in RSR file.
                      Runs same predicts program as reconstructed frequency.
                      Still contains slope in the phase,
                      which results in offset.
                \item input\_rev123\_avg\_iq\_1khz: Crazy phase.
                      Geometry is off by about 10 kilometers or so.
                      Other than that, reconstruction is decent.
                \item input\_rev7E\_ourFFTpower\_16NperFFT\_more\_pts:
                      Poor resolution. The slope is more gradual than
                      Essam's. Phase is much better and the slope is
                      removed (No more radial offset). 
                \item input\_rev7E\_schinder\_16NperFFT\_more\_pts:
                      Similar to previous input. Wrong $\phi$.
                \item input\_rev7E\_schinder\_32NperFFT\_more\_pts:
                      Same as before. Wrong $\phi$.
                \item input\_rev7E\_schinder\_16NperFFT\_pad20\_more\_pts:
                      Same as before. Wrong $\phi$.
            \end{itemize}
            \item[2017/08/18] Re-ran diffraction correction 
                              with the correct phi values:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item input\_rev7E\_ourFFTpower\_16NperFFT\_more\_pts:
                      Very good match. The phase has been fixed.
                \item input\_rev7E\_schinder\_16NperFFT\_more\_pts:
                      Nearly identical to the previous one. Good fit.
                      Slope in phase mostly removed. Offset gone.
                \item input\_rev7E\_schinder\_16NperFFT\_pad20\_more\_pts:
                      Good fit.
                \item input\_rev7E\_schinder\_32NperFFT\_more\_pts:
                      Better fit than fit with padding.
            \end{itemize}
        \end{enumerate}

                  ensemble of points. Read the App. Opt. articles.

            \begin{itemize}
                \begin{multicols}{4}
                    \item *.cal
                    \item *.geo
                    \item *.obs
                    \item *.tau
                \end{multicols}
            \end{itemize}
            \item Learn about the $\alpha$ of a plot.
            \item Make interactive plot for rev007 E/I. Process all bands.
                  Document results.
            \item Think about user interactive parts.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Geometry
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Mindfully choose the RSR you want. Radial coverage, opening angle, etc.
                \end{itemize}
                \item Phase and power retreival
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Picking start and end SPM
                    \item Choosing nots
                    \item Choosing order of residual frequency fit
                \end{itemize}
                \item Diffraction reconstruction

                    \item Choose resolution, window type, and range.
                \end{itemize}
                \item Look at Essam's new directory structure.

                  integral failed for certain revs where the cubic was
                  non negligible. Note that the quartic term was not
                  the problem, and that undersampling is not the
                  problem either. It is the fact that the FFT for
                  some reason swaps the sign of odd terms. Also not
                  that it is not a window size or a B problem, but
                  rather only dependent on when psi has large odd
                  polynomial terms.
            \item Document in detail the normalization factor that
                  is used for the window width. Include approximate
                  normalization factors that assume psi is equal to
                  the fresnel approximation and show why the factor
                  is need. That is, for large resolutions
                  (Small windows) you'd reconstructions scaled
                  to near zero.
            \item Document the ideal, or optimal, resolution to compare
                  with Essam based on comparisons with $L_{1}$,
                  $L_{2}$, and $L_{\infty}$ for various revs, including
                  old high resolution data sets from various idl .sav
                  files. Include documentation on the effect of using
                  different windows for these comparisons. Show that
                  the best match uses a window (KBMD20) that is not
                  mentioned in MTR86.
            \item Justify mathematically the choices of signs, etc.
                  in the FFTs of the convolution functions, etc.

                  If these are dusty rings, the radio data shouldn't
                  see it. Range 73000 to inner C ring. Compare with
                  Colleen's results.
            \item Essam assumes uniform power across rings, but there is
                  an antenna beam patter. Learn about this. Try this
                  problem on a square well. The wave is a sinc function
                  in terms of the angle from the on-axis ray.
                  The first null is proportional to $\lambda/d$, where
                  $d$ is the antenna diameter. Ask prof French about
                  more accurate numbers and models.

To be objective about when a signal was lost, we adopted the criterion that a signal is lost if its level permanently falls below 3-sigma (99\% confidence level).

Starting at about 11:40 we see systematic increase in the signal frequency with the residual from its value away from LOS reaching a peak value of about 24 Hz at Ka-band close to LOS (see attached figure).  It's also clearly detectable at X-band with peak residual of about 6 Hz. The peak frequency residual is hardly detectable at S-band. The frequency change is definitely not due to the ionosphere. The frequency scaling appears to be proportional to frequency (inversely proportional to wavelength) hence is likely due to neutral media or deviation of spacecraft velocity from trajectory prediction.  The frequency increase appears to eliminates the latter since atmospheric drag is expected to slightly slow down Cassini, hence decreasing not increasing the received Doppler shifted frequency. If true, it would appear that Cassini signals began to sense the upper neutral atmosphere, but I'm not sure since Cassini altitude was too high.
