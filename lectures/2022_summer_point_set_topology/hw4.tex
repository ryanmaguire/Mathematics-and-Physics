    \begin{problem}
        Locally compact has two meanings, unfortunately. And they are not
        equivalent. To avoid ambiguity, some authors call one notion
        \textit{locally compact} and another notion
        \textit{strongly locally compact}.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Locally Compact Topological Space: A locally compact
                topological space is a topological space $(X,\,\tau)$ such that
                for all $x\in{X}$ there is an open set $\mathcal{U}\in\tau$
                and a compact subset $K\subseteq{X}$ such that
                $x\in\mathcal{U}$ and $\mathcal{U}\subseteq{K}$.
            \item Strongly Locally Compact Topological Space: A strongly
                locally compact topological space is a topological space
                $(X,\,\tau)$ such that for all $x\in{X}$ there is a
                neighborhood basis $\mathcal{B}$ of $x$ such that for all
                $\mathcal{U}\in\mathcal{B}$, $\textrm{Cl}_{\tau}(\mathcal{U})$
                is compact.
        \end{itemize}
        Your task is to show there is no ambiguity in a Hausdorff space.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item (1 Point) Prove strongly locally compact implies
                locally compact (No Hausdorffness needed).
            \item (3 Points) Prove that if $(X,\,\tau)$ is Hausdorff, then it
                is locally compact if and only if it is strongly locally
                compact.
        \end{itemize}
        The only space I know of that is locally compact but not strongly
        locally compact is the one point compactification of $\mathbb{Q}$.
        This is compact, since it is a compactification, and hence locally
        compact, but not strongly locally compact. It is not Hausdorff, however.
    \end{problem}
    \begin{problem}
        You've tackled Baire's first category theorem. Every completely
        metrizable space (a space that comes from a complete metric) is a
        Baire space. That is, the intersection of countably
        many open and dense subsets is still dense. You will now prove Baire's
        second category theorem, a locally compact Hausdorff space is a
        Baire space.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item (2 Points)
                Prove that if $(X,\,\tau)$ is a topological space, and if for
                all $\in\mathbb{N}$ $\mathcal{C}_{n}\subseteq{X}$ is a non-empty
                closed compact subset such that
                $\mathcal{C}_{n+1}\subseteq\mathcal{C}_{n}$, then
                $\bigcap_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\mathcal{C}_{n}$ is non-empty.
                [Hint: Contradiction works well here. If it is empty, can you
                cover $\mathcal{C}_{0}$ with certain sets? Does this open cover
                have a finite subcover?]
            \item (2 Points)
                Prove that if $(X,\,\tau)$ is locally compact and Hausdorff, if
                $x\in{X}$, and if $\mathcal{U}\in\tau$ is such that
                $x\in\mathcal{U}$, then there is a compact $K\subseteq{X}$ and
                an open $\mathcal{V}\in\tau$ such that
                $x\in\mathcal{V}$, $\mathcal{V}\subseteq{K}$, and
                $K\subseteq\mathcal{U}$. [Hint: Locally compact Hausdorff
                implies regular.]
        \end{itemize}
        From here, the proof is a mimicry of the idea for completely metrizable
        spaces. Given $\mathcal{U}_{n}$, $n\in\mathbb{N}$, open and dense,
        and $\mathcal{W}\in\tau$ non-empty, we construct nested open sets
        $\mathcal{V}_{n}\subseteq\mathcal{W}\cap\bigcap_{k=0}^{n}\mathcal{U}_{k}$
        and compact nested non-empty sets $K_{n}$ such that
        $K_{n+1}\subseteq\mathcal{V}_{n}$. Using the intersection property of
        the $K_{n}$, we conclude $\mathcal{W}\cap\bigcap_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\mathcal{U}_{k}$
        is non-empty, meaning $\bigcap_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\mathcal{U}_{n}$ is
        dense. Note, the first Baire category theorem is not stronger than the
        second Baire category theorem, and vice-versa. The Paris plane is
        completely metrizable, but not locally compact. The long line is locally
        compact and Hausdorff, but not paracompact, and hence not metrizable,
        and hence not competely metrizable. Both theorems have separate
        applications that make them equally useful.
    \end{problem}
    \begin{problem}
        Let $(X,\,\tau)$ be a topological space. Prove that if
        $\mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathcal{P}(X)$ is locally finite (that is,
        every point $x\in{X}$ has an open set $\mathcal{U}\in\tau$ such that
        $x\in\mathcal{U}$ and $\mathcal{U}$ has non-empty intersection with
        only finitely many elements of $\mathcal{A}$), then the following are
        true:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item (2 Points) The set $\mathcal{A}'$ defined by:
                \begin{equation}
                    \mathcal{A}'=
                    \{\,\textrm{Cl}_{\tau}(A)\;|\;A\in\mathcal{A}\,\}
                \end{equation}
                is locally finite as well.
            \item (2 Points)
                \begin{equation}
                    \textrm{Cl}_{\tau}\Big(\bigcup_{A\in\mathcal{A}}A\Big)
                    =\bigcup_{A\in\mathcal{A}}\big(\textrm{Cl}_{\tau}(A)\big)
                \end{equation}
        \end{itemize}
        Note there is no requirement that $\mathcal{A}$ covers $X$, nor is there
        a requirement that $\mathcal{A}$ consists of open sets. The only
        requirement is that the collection of sets is locally finite.
    \end{problem}
    \begin{problem}
        Some definitions from class.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Basis: A basis for a topological space $(X,\,\tau)$ is a
                subset $\mathcal{B}\subseteq\tau$ such that $\mathcal{B}$ is an
                open cover of $X$, and such that for all
                $\mathcal{U},\mathcal{V}\in\mathcal{B}$ and for all
                $x\in\mathcal{U}\cap\mathcal{V}$ there is a
                $\mathcal{W}\in\mathcal{B}$ such that $x\in\mathcal{W}$ and
                $\mathcal{W}\subseteq\mathcal{U}\cap\mathcal{V}$.
            \item Locally Finite Collection: A locally finite collections of
                sets in a topological space $(X,\,\tau)$ is a set
                $\mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathcal{P}(X)$ such that for all $x\in{X}$
                there is a $\mathcal{U}\in\tau$ such that $x\in\mathcal{U}$ and
                only finitely many elements of $\mathcal{A}$ have non-empty
                intersection with $\mathcal{U}$.
            \item $\sigma$ Locally Finite Collection: A $\sigma$ locally finite
                collection of sets in a topological space $(X,\,\tau)$ is a set
                $\mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathcal{P}(X)$ such that there exists
                countably many sets $\mathcal{A}_{n}$, each of which is locally
                finite in $(X,\,\tau)$, such that
                $\mathcal{A}=\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\mathcal{A}_{n}$.
            \item $\sigma$ Locally Finite Basis: A $\sigma$ locally finite
                basis of a topological space $(X,\,\tau)$ is a basis
                $\mathcal{B}$ of $\tau$ such that $\mathcal{B}$ is $\sigma$
                locally finite.
            \item Locally Metrizable: A locally metrizable topological space
                is a topological space $(X,\,\tau)$ such that for all $x\in{X}$
                there is a $\mathcal{U}\in\tau$ such that $x\in\mathcal{U}$ and
                $(\mathcal{U},\,\tau_{\mathcal{U}})$ is metrizable, where
                $\tau_{\mathcal{U}}$ is the subspace topology.
        \end{itemize}
        From class, the Nagata-Smirnov theorem says $(X,\,\tau)$ is metrizable
        if and only if it is Hausdorff, regular,
        and has a $\sigma$ locally finite basis. You may use this freely.
        \textbf{Smirnov's Theorem}: $(X,\,\tau)$ is metrizable if and only if
        it is Hausdorff, paracompact, and locally metrizable. One direction has
        already been proved. Metrizable implies Hausdorff, metrizable definitely
        implies locally metrizable (for each $x\in{X}$ pick $\mathcal{U}=X$),
        and metrizable implies paracompact by Stone's theorem (from class).
        Prove the other direction. Let $(X,\,\tau)$ be Hausdorff, locally
        metrizable, and paracompact. Prove it is metrizable.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item (1 Point) Why is $(X,\,\tau)$ regular?
            \item (2 Points) From being locally metrizable, there is an open
                cover $\mathcal{O}\subseteq\tau$ such that for all
                $\mathcal{U}\in\mathcal{O}$,
                $(\mathcal{U},\,\tau_{\mathcal{U}})$ is metrizable. Given
                $\mathcal{U}\in\mathcal{O}$, let $d_{\mathcal{U}}$ be a metric
                that induces $\tau_{\mathcal{U}}$. Given $x\in\mathcal{U}$
                and $\varepsilon>0$, the set
                $B_{\varepsilon}^{(\mathcal{U},\,d_{\mathcal{U}})}(x)$ is open
                in $\tau_{\mathcal{U}}$ since $d_{\mathcal{U}}$ induces
                $\tau_{\mathcal{U}}$. Why is this open ball open in $\tau$?
            \item (1 Point) Given $q\in\mathbb{Q}^{+}$ let
                $\mathcal{A}_{q}$ be the set of all such balls of radius $q$
                for all points $x\in\mathcal{U}$ for all
                $\mathcal{U}\in\mathcal{O}$. Why is there is locally finite
                open refinement $\mathcal{X}_{q}$ of $\mathcal{A}_{q}$?
            \item (1 Point) Why is the union of all $\mathcal{A}_{q}$ for all
                $q\in\mathbb{Q}^{+}$ $\sigma$ locally finite?
            \item (3 Points) Show that
                $\mathcal{A}=\bigcup_{q\in\mathbb{Q}^{+}}\mathcal{A}_{q}$ is a
                basis for $\tau$.
            \item (2 Points) Conclude that $(X,\,\tau)$ is metrizable.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{problem}
    \begin{problem}
        (4 Points)
        The real projective space $\mathbb{RP}^{n}$ is the quotient of
        $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}\setminus\{\,\mathbf{0}\,\}$ by the equivalence
        relation $\mathbf{y}R\mathbf{x}$ if and only if
        $\mathbf{y}=\lambda\mathbf{x}$ for some
        $\lambda\in\mathbb{R}\setminus\{\,0\,\}$. Equipped with the quotient
        topology, $\mathbb{RP}^{n}$ is a topological manifold (this was proven
        in class). Show that $\mathbb{RP}^{n}$ is a compact
        topological manifold.
    \end{problem}
    \begin{problem}
        Prove that $(X,\,\tau)$ is a topological manifold if and only if
        it is locally Euclidean, Hausdorff, and $\sigma$ compact.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item (2 Points) Prove a metrizable Lindel\"{o}f space is
                second countable. [Hint: For all $n\in\mathbb{N}$, cover the
                space is $1/(n+1)$ balls. Use Lindel\"{o}f to extract a
                countable subcover $\mathcal{B}_{n}$. Consider the collection
                of all such open sets for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$. Prove this is
                a countable basis.]
            \item (2 Points) $\sigma$ compact implies Lindel\"{o}f. Using
                locally Euclidean, Hausdorff, and $\sigma$ compact, prove
                $(X,\,\tau)$ is compactly exhaustible. From class, a
                compactly exhaustible space is paracompact, hence
                $(X,\,\tau)$ is a locally metrizable (since locally Euclidean),
                Hausdorff, paracompact space, so by Smirnov's theorem it is
                metrizable. The previous part of the problem then shows that
                $(X,\,\tau)$ is second countable.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{problem}
    \begin{problem}
        (12 Points) This can be quite tricky, so I've made the bounty 12 points.
        Hopefully this pleases the masses. Let $(X,\,\tau)$ be locally
        Euclidean (for all $x\in{X}$ there is an open set
        $\mathcal{U}\in\tau$, $x\in\mathcal{U}$, and an injective continuous
        open mapping $f:\mathcal{U}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n}$
        for some $n\in\mathbb{N}$), Hausdorff, and \textbf{connected}
        (this last part is very important). Prove $(X,\,\tau)$ is a
        topological manifold if and only if it is paracompact.
        [Hint: All that is missing is second countability. Prove a
        locally Euclidean, paracompact, connected, Hausdorff space is second
        countable.]
    \end{problem}
    \begin{problem}
        (2 Points) Think of a space $(X,\,\tau)$ that is locally Euclidean,
        Hausdorff, and paracompact, but not a manifold
        (Note: The assumption of connectedness has been dropped).
        [Hint: Give $\mathbb{R}$ a topology that comes from a
        particular metric. Problem 7 says the space better be disconnected.]
    \end{problem}
