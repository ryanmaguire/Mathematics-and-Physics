    \section{Compactness}
        For a course in point-set topology, if you understand the general
        notions (topological spaces, continuity, Hausdorffness, sequentialness),
        the basis properties (first and second countable), creating new spaces
        (products, subspaces, quotients), the separation ideas
        (regular and normal), connectedness, and compactness, then you have an
        absolutely solid understanding of topology. We've covered all of these
        ideas except compactness, which we've only discussed in the context of
        metric spaces (or \textit{metrizable} spaces). We now take the time to
        study compactness in the general topological setting.
        \par\hfill\par
        In a metric space we proved several theorems about compactness,
        primarily the Bolzano-Weierstrass, Heine-Borel, generalized
        Heine-Borel, and equivalence of compactness theorems. This told us
        that compactness can be described by sequences and by open sets. In the
        topological setting it is more natural to define compactness via open
        sets.
        \begin{definition}[\textbf{Compact Topological Space}]
            A compact topological space is a topological space $(X,\,\tau)$
            such that for all open covers $\mathcal{O}\subseteq\tau$ there is
            a finite subset $\Delta\subseteq\mathcal{O}$ such that $\Delta$ is
            open cover.
        \end{definition}
