    \section{The Equivalence of Compactness Theorem}
        The generalization of the Heine-Borel theorem for general metric spaces
        needs stronger notions than just \textit{closed} and \textit{bounded}.
        If we replace \textit{closed} with \textit{complete} and
        \textit{bounded} with \textit{totally bounded}, we get the
        generalized Heine-Borel theorem.
        \begin{theorem}[\textbf{Generalized Heine-Borel Theorem}]
            If $(X,\,d)$ is a metric space, then it is compact if and only
            if it is complete and totally bounded.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            We have already proven that compact implies complete. Now let's
            show compact implies totally bounded. Suppose not. Then there is
            an $\varepsilon>0$ such that no matter what finite collection of
            points $a_{0},\,\dots,\,a_{n}$ you pick, there is another point
            $a_{n+1}$ where $a_{n+1}\notin{B}_{\varepsilon}^{(X,\,d)}(a_{k})$
            for all $0\leq{k}\leq{n}$. Inductively this defines a sequence
            $a:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow{X}$. But $(X,\,d)$ is compact, so there
            is a convergent subsequence $a_{k}$. But convergent sequences are
            Cauchy sequences, and therefore there there is an
            $N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $m,n>N$ implies
            $d(a_{k_{n}},\,a_{k_{m}})<\varepsilon$. But by construction
            $d(a_{k_{n}},\,a_{k_{m}})\geq\varepsilon$ for all
            $n,m\in\mathbb{N}$, a contradiction. So $(X,\,d)$ is complete.
            Now, suppose $(X,\,d)$ is closed and totally bounded. Let
            $a:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow{X}$ be any sequence. Since
            $(X,\,d)$ is totally bounded, there are finitely many points
            $b_{0},\,\dots,\,b_{N}$ such that the open balls
            $B_{1}^{(X,\,d)}(b_{k})$ completely cover $X$. Since there are
            infinitely integers and only finitely many open balls, there
            must be a point $b_{k}$ such that infinitely many $n\in\mathbb{N}$
            are such that $a_{n}\in{B}_{1}^{(X,\,d)}(b_{k})$. Let
            $k_{0}\in\mathbb{N}$ be such a value
            with $a_{k_{0}}\in{B}_{0}^{(X,\,d)}(b_{k})$. Again by total
            boundedness, we can cover $B_{1}^{(X,\,d)}(b_{k})$ with finitely
            many open balls $B_{\frac{1}{2}}^{(X,\,d)}(c_{m})$ with points
            $c_{m}\in{B}_{1}^{(X,\,d)}(b_{k})$. Since infinitely many integers
            $n\in\mathbb{N}$ are such that $a_{n}\in{B}_{1}^{(X,\,d)}(b_{k})$
            and there are only finitely many balls covering this set,
            one of these open balls must again be such that there are
            infinitely many integers $n\in\mathbb{N}$ with
            $a_{n}\in{B}_{\frac{1}{2}}^{(X,\,d)}(c_{\ell})$. Let
            $k_{1}$ be such that $k_{1}>k_{0}$ and
            $a_{k_{1}}\in{B}_{\frac{1}{2}}^{(X,\,d)}(c_{\ell})$. Inductively
            we get a sequence $a_{k}$. This sequence is Cauchy since
            $d(a_{k_{m}},\,a_{k_{n}})$ is bounded by $\frac{1}{N+1}$ where
            $N=\textrm{min}(m,\,n)$. But $(X,\,d)$ is complete, so this sequence
            converges. Hence $a$ has a convergent subsequence.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{definition}[\textbf{Open Cover of a Metric Space}]
            An open cover of a metric space $(X,\,d)$ is a subset
            $\mathcal{O}\subseteq\tau_{d}$, where $\tau_{d}$ is the metric
            topology, such that $\bigcup\mathcal{O}=X$. That is, for all
            $x\in{X}$, there is an open set $\mathcal{U}\in\mathcal{O}$ such
            that $x\in\mathcal{U}$.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{theorem}[\textbf{Lebesgue's Number Lemma}]
            If $(X,\,d)$ is compact, and if $\mathcal{O}$ is an open cover of
            $(X,\,d)$, then there is a $\delta>0$ such that for all
            $x\in{X}$ there is a $\mathcal{U}\in\mathcal{O}$ such that
            $B_{\delta}^{(X,\,d)}(x)\subseteq\mathcal{U}$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            Suppose not. Then for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$ there is an
            $a_{n}$ such that $B_{\frac{1}{n+1}}^{(X,\,d)}(a_{n})$ is not
            contained entirely inside of $\mathcal{U}$ for any
            $\mathcal{U}\in\mathcal{O}$. But $(X,\,d)$ is compact, so there
            is a convergent subsequence $a_{k}$. Let $x\in{X}$ be the limit,
            $a_{k_{n}}\rightarrow{x}$. Since $\mathcal{O}$ is an open cover,
            there is a $\mathcal{U}$ with $x\in\mathcal{U}$. But $\mathcal{U}$
            is open, so there is an $\varepsilon>0$ such that
            $B_{\varepsilon}^{(X,\,d)}(x)\subseteq\mathcal{U}$. But since
            $a_{k_{n}}\rightarrow{x}$ there is an $N_{0}\in\mathbb{N}$ such that
            $k_{n}>N$ implies $d(x,\,a_{k_{n}})<\frac{\varepsilon}{2}$. Let
            $N_{1}\in\mathbb{N}$ be such that $N+1>\frac{2}\varepsilon$ and
            let $N=\textrm{max}(N_{0},\,N_{1})$. Then
            $y\in{B}_{\frac{1}{N+1}}^{(X,\,d)}(a_{N})$ implies:
            \begin{equation}
                d(x,\,y)\leq{d}(x,\,a_{N})+d(a_{N},\,y)
                    <\frac{\varepsilon}{2}+\frac{\varepsilon}{2}=\varepsilon
            \end{equation}
            and hence $y\in{B}_{\varepsilon}^{(X,\,d)}(x)$. But then
            $B_{\frac{1}{N+1}}^{(X,\,d)}(a_{N})\subseteq\mathcal{U}$, which is
            a contradiction, completing the proof.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}[\textbf{The Equivalence of Compactness Theorem}]
            If $(X,\,d)$ is a metric space, then $(X,\,d)$ is compact if and
            only if for every open cover $\mathcal{O}$ of $(X,\,d)$ there exists
            a finite open cover $\Delta\subseteq\mathcal{O}$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            If $(X,\,d)$ is compact and $\mathcal{O}$ is an open cover, then
            by the Lebesgue number lemma there is a $\delta>0$ such that for
            all $x\in{X}$ there is a $\mathcal{U}_{x}$ such that
            $B_{\delta}^{(X,\,d)}(x)\subseteq\mathcal{U}_{x}$. Since
            $(X,\,d)$ is compact, it is totally bounded, and hence there are
            finitely many points $x_{0},\,\dots,\,x_{N}$ such that the
            $\delta$ balls centered at $x_{n}$ cover $X$. But then the set:
            \begin{equation}
                \Delta=\{\,\mathcal{U}_{x_{0}},\,\dots,\,\mathcal{U}_{n_{N}}\,\}
            \end{equation}
            is a finite open cover that is a subset of $\mathcal{O}$. In the
            other direction, suppose $(X,\,d)$ is such that every open cover
            $\mathcal{O}$ contains a finite subset $\Delta\subseteq\mathcal{O}$
            that is also an open cover of $(X,\,d)$. Given $\varepsilon>0$,
            create the set $\mathcal{O}$ by:
            \begin{equation}
                \mathcal{O}=\{\,B_{\varepsilon}^{(X,\,d)}(x)\;|\;x\in{X}\,\}
            \end{equation}
            $\mathcal{O}$ is an open cover of $(X,\,d)$, and hence there is a
            finite open cover $\Delta\subseteq\mathcal{O}$. But then $(X,\,d)$
            can be covered by finitely many balls of radius $\varepsilon$, so
            $(X,\,d)$ is totally bounded. Next, suppose $(X,\,d)$ is not
            complete. There there is a Cauchy sequence
            $a:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow{X}$ that does not converge. Then for all
            $x\in{X}$ there is a $\varepsilon_{x}>0$ such that for all
            $N\in\mathbb{N}$ there exists $n>N$ with
            $d(x,\,a_{n})\geq\varepsilon$. Let $\mathcal{O}$ be defined by:
            \begin{equation}
                \mathcal{O}=\{\,B_{\varepsilon_{x}/2}^{(X,\,d)}(x)\;|\;x\in{X}\,\}
            \end{equation}
            $\mathcal{O}$ is an open cover of $(X,\,d)$, so there is a finite
            open cover $\Delta\subseteq\mathcal{O}$. Let
            $x_{0},\,\dots,x_{N}$ be the finite set of points such that:
            \begin{equation}
                X=\bigcup_{n=0}^{N}B_{\varepsilon_{n}}^{(X,\,d)}(x_{n})
            \end{equation}
            where $\varepsilon_{n}=\varepsilon_{x_{n}}$. Let
            $\varepsilon=\frac{1}{2}\textrm{min}(\varepsilon_{0},\,\dots,\,\varepsilon_{N})$.
            Since $a:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow{X}$ is a Cauchy sequence, there is
            an $N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $n,m>N$ implies
            $d(a_{m},\,a_{n})<\varepsilon$. But then:
            \begin{equation}
                d(x,\,a_{n})\leq{d}(a_{n},\,a_{m})+d(x,\,a_{n})<\varepsilon
            \end{equation}
            a contradiction, so $(X,\,d)$ is complete. But then
            $(X,\,d)$ is complete and totally bounded, and therefore compact.
        \end{proof}
