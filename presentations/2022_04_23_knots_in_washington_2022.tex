    \maketitle
    \begin{frame}{\textbf{\color{red}{Corrections}}}
        A bug was discovered in the Knot Floer Homology (KFH) code that led to
        false negatives. The conjecture as presented in this talk for
        KFH and Legendrian simple knots is false and counterexamples have been
        found. For Khovanov homology the conjecture still stands as of this
        correction (written 2023/02/27).
        \par\hfill\par
        The remainder of these slides are unchanged from the original talk.
    \end{frame}
    \begin{frame}{Outline}
        A theorem of Kronheimer and Mrowka shows that Khovanov homology is
        an \textit{unknot} detector. There is currently an open question as to
        whether the Jones polynomial is also an unknot detector.
        \par\hfill\par
        One could ask if this theorem is a special case of a more general claim.
        The unknot is the simplest of the torus knots, which are knots that are
        known to be Legendrian simple. These are used to test the question
        \textit{does Khovanov homology detect Legendrian simple knots}?
        Numerical evidence up to 17 crossings is provided.
        \par\hfill\par
        A similar question about \textit{transverse knots} is posed and
        numerical evidence has been gathered using the twist knots. These
        questions are also posed for Knot Floer Homology, which is also a
        known unknot detector.
    \end{frame}
    \begin{frame}{Outline}
        To gather numerical evidence one could simply get a giant list of knots
        and start computing the Khovanov and Knot Floer homologies for all
        torus and twist knots up to a certain number of crossings, and compare
        the results with all knots up to 17 crossings.
        \par\hfill\par
        These homologies are expensive to compute meaning this is not feasible.
        Instead, the Jones and Alexander polynomials are computed and compared.
        Only if matching polynomials are found are the
        homologies computed. This simplification greatly reduces computation
        time. One could, with the aid of computer, calculate the Jones
        polynomial of all knots up to 17 crossings in an hour or so.
        \par\hfill\par
        As an added bonus, the Jones and Alexander polynomials of
        torus and twist knots have well-known closed forms, reducing part of the
        calculation entirely.
    \end{frame}
    \begin{frame}{Outline}
        The following python packages were used:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \texttt{regina}
            \item \texttt{snappy}
        \end{itemize}
        and the \texttt{sage} knot theory library was used as well.
        In addition, my own ever-growing C library was used. The algorithm
        implemented will be briefly described.
    \end{frame}
    \begin{frame}{Gauss Code}
        Take a knot, orient it, and label the crossings from 0 to $N-1$.
        Starting at the 0 crossing, travel along the knot and when you come
        to a crossing, record the crossing number and whether you're on the
        \textit{over} strand or the \textit{under} strand. The string of length
        $2N$ you've obtained is the \textit{Gauss code} of the knot.

        Problem: Different knots can have the same Gauss code.%
        \footnote{%
            It bothers me that there's only \textit{one} trefoil knot in every
            knot table.
        }
        Take the left-handed trefoil, similar orientation and labelling scheme
        as before, but different starting point. The resulting code is the same
        as before. The left and right handed Trefoils are different since
        their Jones polynomials are different.
        \begin{figure}

    \begin{frame}{Gauss Code}
        Solution: Sign the crossings. At every crossing, rotate your head until
        the crossing looks like one of the ones below. Call the one on the left
        a \textit{negative crossing} and the one on the right \textit{positive}.

        \end{figure}
    \end{frame}
    \begin{frame}{Gauss Code}
        By also recording the sign, we get \textit{extended Gauss code}.
        \begin{figure}
            \centering
            \includegraphics{%

    \begin{frame}{Gauss Code}
        The rules:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Gauss code is a finite sequence of length $2N$ of ordered
                  triples.
            \item The ordered triples are of the form $(s,n,t)$ with
                  $s\in\{-1,+1\}$, $t\in\{O,U\}$, and $0\leq{n}\leq{N-1}$.
                  ($s$ for \textit{sign}, $t$ for \textit{type}).
            \item Every integer $0\leq{n}\leq{N-1}$ occurs exactly twice in the
                  code, once with $O$ and once with $U$. The sign is does not
                  change.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{frame}
    \begin{frame}{Gauss Code}
        The three Reidemeister moves translate to fairly simple operations on
        Gauss code.\footnote{HW what are they?}
        Here's a two crossing \textit{knot}.
        \begin{equation}
            O0\;O1\;U0\;U1
        \end{equation}
        You'll find no Reidemeister moves can reduce this to the unknot.
    \end{frame}
    \begin{frame}{Gauss Code}
        If you try to draw the knot from this code, you'll get the following.
        There's this \textit{fake} crossing.

        \end{figure}
    \end{frame}
    \begin{frame}{Gauss Code}
        The graph theorist in you knows that we really want to draw this on a
        torus.%
        \footnote{Ever try and draw $K_{5}$ without crossings?}

    \end{frame}
    \begin{frame}{Gauss Code}
        Perhaps this is easier to visualize on a flat torus.

    \end{frame}
    \begin{frame}{Gauss Code}
        We can detect the virtual genus from the Gauss code. Take the
        right-handed trefoil and thicken it. Start anywhere you'd like, but
        place your finger on the \textit{left} strand and start walking forward.
        When you encounter a crossing, go left! Eventually you'll end up back
        where you started. Keep doing this until you've traversed all of the
        strands, keeping track of the total number of cycles.
        \begin{figure}

            \label{fig:trefoil_knot_framed_001}
        \end{figure}
    \end{frame}
    \begin{frame}{Gauss Code}
        To conclude, use the following:
        \begin{equation}
            V-E+F=2-2g
        \end{equation}
        You've just computed $F$! $V$ is the number of crossings, and
        $E$ is always $2V$ (the knot graph is a four-valent multigraph. By the
        hand-shaking theorem, $E=4V/2=2V$). So:
        \begin{equation}
            g=\frac{V-F+2}{2}
        \end{equation}
        This method of computing virtual genus is obtainable via the Gauss
        code. The idea of chasing around the diagram can be modified to compute
        the Kauffman bracket.
    \end{frame}
    \begin{frame}{The Kauffman Bracket and Jones Polynomial}
        The Kauffman Bracket is defined recursively in terms of smoothings of a
        crossing. Given a crossing, there are two ways to make it
        \textit{go away}. We will label these the 0 and 1 smoothings, see below.
        \begin{figure}

        \end{figure}
    \end{frame}
    \begin{frame}{The Kauffman Bracket and Jones Polynomial}
        Given a knot with $N$ crossings, with crossings labeled 0 to $N-1$,
        and any integer $0\leq{n}\leq{2}^{N}-1$, there is a unique resolution of
        all crossings corresponding to $n$. Write $n$ in binary. The value of
        the $k^{th}$ bit tells us how we are supposed to smooth the $k^{th}$
        crossing.

        The following took far too long to make.

    \begin{frame}
        The Kauffman bracket is defined recursively as follows:
        \begin{align}
            \langle\emptyset\rangle&=1\\
            \langle{L\sqcup\mathbb{S}^{1}}\rangle&=(q+q^{-1})\langle{L}\rangle\\
            \langle{L}\rangle&=
                \langle{L_{n,0}}\rangle-q\langle{L_{n,1}}\rangle
        \end{align}
        where $L_{n,0}$ and $L_{n,1}$ are the links obtained from the
        0 and 1 smoothings of $L$ at the $n^{th}$ crossing, respectively. The
        notation $L\sqcup\mathbb{S}^{1}$ means the disjoint union of
        $L$ with an unknot. Hence the Kauffman bracket of the
        unknot is $q+q^{-1}$.
        \begin{theorem}
            The Kauffman bracket is invariant under Reidemeister II and III
            moves.
        \end{theorem}
        It is not invariant under Reidemeister I.
    \end{frame}
    \begin{frame}{The Kauffman Bracket and the Jones Polynomial}
        If you have something that is invariant under Reidemeister II and III,
        you should try to introduce the \textit{writhe}%
        \footnote{Sum of the signs of the crossings}
        into the problem since only Reidemeister I changes the writhe of a
        diagram. The Jones polynomial does exactly this:
        \begin{equation}
            J(L)(q)=(-1)^{N_{-}}q^{N_{-}-2N_{+}}\langle{L}\rangle
        \end{equation}
        $N_{\pm}$ being the number of positive and negative crossings,
        respectively.
        \begin{theorem}
            The Jones polynomial is a knot invariant.
        \end{theorem}
    \end{frame}
    \begin{frame}{Khovanov Homology}
        You can get a homology theory by ``categorifying" the Jones polynomial.
        This is Khovanov homology, the graded Euler characteristic of which
        gives you the Jones polynomial. I won't be
        discussing heavy details about Khovanov homology.
        The recursive definition of the chain complex is as follows:
        \begin{align}
            [[\emptyset]]&=0\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}\rightarrow{0}\\
            [[L\sqcup\mathbb{S}^{1}]]&=V\otimes[[L]]\\
            [[L]]&=\mathcal{F}\big(
                0\rightarrow[[L_{n,0}]]\rightarrow[[L_{n,1}]]\{1\}\rightarrow{0}
            \big)
        \end{align}
        $V$ is a graded vector space, $\{\ell\}$ is the
        \textit{degree shift} operation, and $\mathcal{F}$ is the flatten
        operation of graded vector spaces. Like the Kauffman bracket, we need
        the writhe to a get a true knot invariant. The chain complex is
        $C(L)=[[L]][N_{-}]\{N_{-}-2N_{+}\}$, $[\ell]$ is the height shift
        operation on chain complexes. Khovanov homology is the resulting
        homology from this (chain maps are not defined in this talk).
    \end{frame}
    \begin{frame}{Khovanov Homology}
        The \textit{Khovanov polnyomial} is obtained via
	    \begin{equation}
	        Kh(L)(q,t)=
	        \sum_{r,\ell}t^{r}q^{\ell}\textrm{dim}\big(KH_{\ell}^{r}(L)\big)
	    \end{equation}
	    The relation to the Jones polynomial is
	    \begin{equation}
	        J(L)(q)=Kh(q,-1)
	    \end{equation}
    \end{frame}
    \begin{frame}{Khovanov Homology}
        The na\"{i}ve recursive algorithm for Khovanov homology is exponential
        in both time and space. Most algorithm talks only care about time,
        since in the modern era it seems we have infinite space. The following
        is an excerpt from an email I recently sent:
        \begin{flushright}
            \textit{
                I ran time\footnote{Unix time and memory command}
                to see how much memory the algorithm takes.
                For n=10 and n=12, I get 0.65 GB and 9.33 GB, respectively.
                The algorithm is EXP in space, so I did a best fitting
                exponential. For n=14 (which is what is needed), the output is
                132.5 GB. Yikes.
            }
        \end{flushright}
    \end{frame}
    \begin{frame}{Khovanov Homology}
        There are a few implementations of Khovanov homology available.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item One is written in Mathematica, which is not an open language.%
                  \footnote{Current pricing options are \$19/month
                            or \$183/year. Ouch.}
            \item Another is written an Java which I couldn't compile but thanks
                  to the magic of Nikolay Pultsin, it's working with OpenJDK.
            \item The sage implementation requires a super computer to actually
                  use (see previous email).
        \end{itemize}
        The Java version has been used to compare Khovanov homologies of
        knots with the same Jones polynomial as some torus or twist knot.
    \end{frame}
    \begin{frame}{An Algorithm for the Jones Polynomial}
        We'll first start with smaller means. We'll tackle the Jones
        polynomial. We'll do this by computing the Kauffman bracket. Using the
        recursive definition we can inductively prove the following formula:
        \begin{equation}
            \label{eqn:kauffman_bracket}%
            \langle{L}\rangle=\sum_{n=0}^{2^{N}-1}
                (-q)^{w(n)}(q+q^{-1})^{c(n)}
        \end{equation}
        Here, $w(n)$ is the \textit{Hamming weight} of $n$, the number of 1's
        that occur in the binary representation of $n$. $c(n)$ is the
        \textit{circle counting function}, the number of disjoint circles that
        result from the complete resolution of $L$ corresponding to $n$.
        To compute $\langle{L}\rangle$ we need only compute $c(n)$.
    \end{frame}
    \begin{frame}{An Algorithm for the Jones Polynomial}
        First, thicken the knot. All of the crossings then become
        ``four-way intersections."

        Life will be easier if we label the four-way intersection. Given a
        positive or negative crossing, we will label the four roads as follows:

        Create a table with $4N$ entries, all of which are set to 0.
        Start at the 0 crossing in the Gauss code. Pictorially, you are walking
        towards the crossing from road 0. You now need to know which road to
        leave from. Let's suppose the sign of the crossing is negative, and
        you are supposed to do the zero resolution for this crossing. The
        previous figure shows that we must travel down doad 1. But hold on,
        the arrows are pointing the wrong way! So we must walk backwards.
        \par\hfill\par
        What does this mean? Find the next entry in the Gauss code for the 0
        crossing (If the first entry is $O0-$, find $U0-$, and vice-versa).
        Since we are walking backwards, from there go to the \textit{previous}
        entry in the Gauss code (that's what walking backwards means). We have
        traversed roads 0 and 1 for the 0 crossing, so change entries 0 and 1 of
        our table to 1.
    \end{frame}
    \begin{frame}{An Algorithm for the Jones Polynomial}
        We continue this idea for all other crossings. We just need to know
        which road to leave from, given the crossing sign, type, and resolution,
        and which road we are entering from for the next crossing. This can be
        obtained by studying the previous figures carefully, but it is
        summarized in the following tables.

        Eventually we will get back to road 0 of the zeroth crossing.
        Make sure to keep track of which roads you've travelled. If you've
        entered or exited through road $0\leq{k}\leq{3}$ of the $n^{th}$
        crossing, change the $4n+k$ entry of the table to one.
        \par\hfill\par
        After you've completed your cycle, find the first entry in the table
        that is still zero and repeat this process. After at most $4N$ steps,
        you'll be done. The number of cycles you've counted is the number of
        circles that resulted from the given resolution.

        Benefits:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Time complexity is $O(N2^{N})$, so no worse than the
                  recursive algorithm.
            \item The algorithm is $O(N)$ in space! Significantly better than
                  $O(2^{N})$. The reason being we don't need to store all
                  resolutions in memory. We can do one at a time, add the
                  result to our polynomial, and continue.
            \item The idea works for virtual knots. There is no restriction to
                  the classical setting.
        \end{itemize}

    \begin{frame}{Conjectures on Khovanov and Knot Floer Homology}
        A Legendrian knot is an embedding of $\mathbb{S}^{1}$ into
        $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ that is everywhere tangent to the standard
        contact structure.
        \par\hfill\par
        Every knot is topologically equivalent to a Legendrian knot. Two
        Legendrian knots are said to be equivalent if they are equivalent
        through a homotopy of Legendrian knots.
        \par\hfill\par
        It is possible for inequivalent
        Legendrian knots to be equivalent as topological knots.
        \par\hfill\par
        If Legendrian knots in a given topological knot type are uniquely
        determined by two classical invariants (their Thurston-Bennequin
        numbers and rotation numbers), they are said to be Legendrian simple.
    \end{frame}
    \begin{frame}{Conjectures on Khovanov and Knot Floer Homology}
        We can similarly define transverse knots, which are knots that are
        everywhere \textit{transverse} to the contact structure.
        \par\hfill\par
        We can again consider transverse knots up to equivalence via homotopy
        through transverse knots.

    \begin{frame}{Conjectures on Khovanov and Knot Floer Homology}
        It is known that torus knots are Legendrian simple.
        \par\hfill\par
        Two results have shown that Khovanov homology (Mrowka and Kronheimer)
        and Knot Floer homology (Ozv\'{a}th and Szab\'{o}) are unknot detectors.
        The unknot being the simplest of the torus knots, a somewhat natural
        generalization would be that these two homology theories
        distinguish the Legendrian simple knots.
        \par\hfill\par
        Using the algorithm outlined, numerical evidence for this has been
        collected for all knots up to 17 crossings (roughly 8 million knots).
    \end{frame}
    \begin{frame}{Conjectures on Khovanov and Knot Floer Homology}
        An open analogous question for the Jones polynomial is whether it too
        detects the unknot. This is not true of torus knots. There are
        non-torus knots with the same Jones polynomial as a torus knot.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $T(2,5)$ matches a 10 crossing knot.
            \item $T(2,7)$ matches a 12 crossing knot.
            \item $T(2,11)$ matches a 14 crossing knot.
        \end{itemize}
        Any patterns? $T(n,m)$ is always of the form $(2,\text{prime})$,
        the second number is always increasing by 2. Hmm.
    \end{frame}
    \begin{frame}{Conjectures on Khovanov and Knot Floer Homology}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $T(2,5)$ matches a 17 crossing knot.
        \end{itemize}
        Well dang, there's goes that trend.
        \par\hfill\par
        Still, $T(n,m)$ is always of the form $(2,\text{prime})$. It would
        be nice to know if there are infinitely many of these matches.
        \par\hfill\par

        A similar search yielded no matches for Knot Floer Homology.%

        Much the way Khovanov homology is the categorification of the Jones
        polynomial, so is Knot Floer homology for the Alexander polynomial.
        \par\hfill\par
        The Alexander polynomial is first computed (this is polynomial time,
        much better than the Jones polynomial), and if matches were found the
        Knot Floer homologies were compared as well (slow, exponential in time).
        \par\hfill\par
        Much worse than the Jones polynomial, roughly 5,000 knots had the
        same Alexander polynomial as some torus knot. Most matching
        the trefoil, cinquefoil, septefoil, and $T(3,4)$.

    \begin{frame}{Conjectures on Khovanov and Knot Floer Homology}
        Twist knots were also checked to check for this conjecture for
        transversally simple knots. Not all twist knots are transversally
        simple, but some are.
        \par\hfill\par
        For up to 17 crossings, 9 knots had the same Jones polynomial as a
        twist knot. In all cases the Khovanov homologies were different.
        A similar statement holds for Knot Floer Homology.

            \item More crossings! There is a publicly available database with
                the DT code of all knots up to 19 crossings.
            \item Check the code. In programming there's always room for
                mistakes.
            \item Parallelize the code. I have 24 cores on my computer, and I
                want to use them, dag-nabbit.
