# Photos
This directory contains images and paintings of mathematicians and physicists
described throughout the book. Since the images are not produced via code, the
raw files must be kept in this repository since there is no means of "building"
them later.

All photos are works that are in the public domain, or released under the GNU
Free Documentation License.
