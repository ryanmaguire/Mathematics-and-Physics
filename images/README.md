# Images
This directory stores the images that are used throughout the project. Formerly
I had a shell script compile all of the code necessary to generate the
figures, but shell scripts do not work on windows. For the sake of ease, the
image files are now stored here in their normal formats. The source code for
all of the images are provided within this repository and are released under
the GPL3 license.
