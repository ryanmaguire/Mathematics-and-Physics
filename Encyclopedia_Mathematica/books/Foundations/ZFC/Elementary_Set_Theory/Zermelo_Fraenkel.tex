\section{The Axioms of Zermelo and Fraenkel}
    The first thing to do is define what \textit{sets}\index{Set} are.
    \begin{fdefinition}{Sets}{Sets}
        A \gls{set} is a collection of objects (or elements), none of which is
        the set itself.
    \end{fdefinition}
    If we wish to stand on a truly solid foundation, it seems we're off to a bad
    start. In defining sets we used the words \textit{collection} and
    \textit{objects}, neither of which have been defined. This is the problem
    found in Chapt.~\ref{chapt:Logic} when defining connectives. To begin
    stating definitions and theorems we need the existence of a \textit{thing}.
    Sets act as our thing. We know they exist, but we don't know how to define
    them all to well. Nevertheless, we can describe how they behave and what
    they can do, as well as how to obtain new sets from pre-existing ones.
    \begin{fnotation}{Element Notation}{Element_Notation}
        If $A$ is a \gls{set} and if $x$ is an element\index{Element (Sets)} of
        $A$, then we denote this by writing $x\in{A}$. If $x$ is not an element
        of $A$, we write $x\notin{A}$.
    \end{fnotation}
    We do not yet know that sets exist. Pedagogically it seems poor to wait
    for examples, so we'll speak loosely for the moment so we may familiarize
    ourselves with the notation.
    \begin{fexample}{Using Element Notation}{Using_Element_Notation}
        Given a set $A$ that contains only a few objects, we can represent $A$
        by listing out the elements, separated by commas, and enclosing them in
        braces. Suppose $A$ is the set that contains three distinct objects
        labelled $a$, $b$, and $c$. We then write:
        \begin{equation}
            A=\big\{\,a,\,b,\,c\,\big\}
        \end{equation}
        If we are told that there is a fourth object $d$ that is different from
        $a$, $b$, and $c$, then we can use the notation defined in
        Not.~\ref{not:Element_Notation} to write the following:
        \par\hfill\par
        \begin{subequations}
            \begin{minipage}[b]{0.49\textwidth}
                \begin{equation}
                    a\in{A}
                \end{equation}
            \end{minipage}
            \hfill
            \begin{minipage}[b]{0.49\textwidth}
                \begin{equation}
                    d\notin{A}
                \end{equation}
            \end{minipage}
        \end{subequations}
        \par\vspace{2.5ex}
        The notation $a\in{A}$ should be read as \textit{a is an element of A},
        or \textit{a is contained in A}, or simply \textit{a is in A}.
        Similarly, the notation $d\notin{A}$ should be read as
        \textit{d is not an element of A}, or \textit{d is not contained in A}.
        \par\hfill\par
        $A$ is an example of a \textit{finite} set\index{Finite Set}, moreover
        it contains only three elements. For larger sets we rely on other
        methods to write them down. One such means is to indicate a pattern and
        use an ellipses to show that it goes on. Such a description is vague and
        lacks rigor, but can be helpful when the pattern is obvious. The set of
        all \textit{natural} numbers\index{Natural Numbers}, or non-negative
        integers (denoted $\mathbb{N}$) can be loosely represented by writing:
        \begin{equation}
            \label{eqn:Natural_Numbers_Ellipses}%
            \mathbb{N}=\big\{\,0,\,1,\,2,\,3,\,4,\,5,\,\dots\,\big\}
        \end{equation}
        Using our developed notation, we can write:
        \par\hfill\par
        \begin{subequations}
            \begin{minipage}[b]{0.49\textwidth}
                \begin{equation}
                    23\in\mathbb{N}
                \end{equation}
            \end{minipage}
            \hfill
            \begin{minipage}[b]{0.49\textwidth}
                \begin{equation}
                    \minus{4}\notin\mathbb{N}
                \end{equation}
            \end{minipage}
        \end{subequations}
        \par\vspace{2.5ex}
        Letting $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ denote all non-negative integers between 0 and
        $n-1$, we have:
        \begin{equation}
            \label{eqn:Z_n_Ellipses}%
            \mathbb{Z}_{n}=\big\{0,\,1,\,2,\,\dots,\,n-1\,\big\}
        \end{equation}
        Thus $17\in\mathbb{Z}_{18}$ but $19\notin\mathbb{Z}_{18}$. Lastly, we
        present the integers\index{Integers}.
        \begin{equation}
            \label{eqn:Integers_Ellipses}%
            \mathbb{Z}=\big\{\,\dots,\,\minus{3},\,\minus{2},\,\minus{1},
                             \,0,\,1,\,2,\,3,\dots\,\big\}
        \end{equation}
    \end{fexample}
    In our definition of a set (Def.~\ref{def:Sets}) we explicitly required
    that sets cannot contain themselves. That is, if $A$ is a set, then
    $A\notin{A}$. This requirement was introduced to avoid paradoxes discovered
    by Bertrand Russell\index{Russell, Bertrand} in 1901. Allow us to neglect
    this requirement for a moment and reveal why it is essential. Recall from
    logic that a system of mathematics is inconsistent if one can prove a
    contradiction within the theory. In Naive Set Theory\index{Naive Set Theory}
    we allow the \textit{axiom of unrestricted comprehension}%
    \index{Axiom!of Unrestricted Comprehension}. This allows us to constructs
    sets as any definable collection. That is, if we have a proposition $P$,
    then we can define a set $A$ as the set of all objects that satisfy $P$.
    We can write:
    \begin{equation}
        A=\big\{\,x\;|\;P(x)\,\big\}
    \end{equation}
    Problems with such a loose definition arise instantly. Let $P$ be the
    proposition \textit{true if x is a set, false otherwise}. Then
    $A=\{\,x\;|\;P(x)\,\}$ can be read in plain English as the
    \textit{set of all sets}\index{Set!of All Sets}. A natural question would be
    whether or not $A$ then contains itself. That is, is $A\in{A}$? Russell's
    paradox arises by defining proper sets to be sets $B$ such that
    $B\notin{B}$, and improper sets to be sets $B$ such that $B\in{B}$. Using
    the \textit{Law of the Excluded Middle}\index{Law of the Excluded Middle}
    (which we will prove later), one has that every set is either proper or
    improper.
    \begin{ftheorem}{Russell's Paradox}{Russells_Paradox}
        Naive Set Theory is inconsistent.\index{Russell's Paradox}
    \end{ftheorem}
    \begin{bproof}
        For let $P$ be the proposition \textit{true if} $x\notin{x}$,
        \textit{false otherwise}. Let $A$ be the set defined by this
        proposition:
        \begin{equation}
            A=\big\{\,x\;|\;P(x)\,\big\}
        \end{equation}
        That is, $A$ is the set of all sets that do not contain themselves.
        Suppose $A\in{A}$. If $A\in{A}$ then $P(A)$ is true. That is, $A$ is a
        proper set. But proper sets do not contain themselves and $A\in{A}$, a
        contradiction. Thus $A\notin{A}$. But if $A\notin{A}$ than $P(A)$ is
        false. But if $P(A)$ is false, than $A$ is a improper set. But then
        $A\in{A}$, a contradiction as $A\notin{A}$. Thus $A\in{A}$ if and only
        if $A\notin{A}$, a contradiction. Therefore, Naive Set Theory is
        inconsistent.
    \end{bproof}
    Our development of Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory is to avoid this paradox and
    attempt to develop a consistent system of mathematics. The proof of
    Russell's Paradox (Thm.~\ref{thm:Russells_Paradox}) relied on the
    \textit{Law of the Excluded Middle}\index{Law of the Excluded Middle} which
    states that, given a proposition $P$, either $P$ is true or its negation is
    true. Thus we have shown that the axiom of unrestricted
    comprehension\index{Axiom!of Unrestricted Comprehension} and the law of the
    excluded middle are not compatible. This is quite unfortunate as the law of
    the excluded middle is essential in mathematics as it allows one to prove
    things via contradiction\index{Proof by Contradiction}. That is, given some
    statement we assume the opposite is true and arrive at a contradiction thus
    showing the negation of our statement is false. We then invoke the law of
    the excluded middle to show that our original statement is true. The axioms
    of Zermelo and Fraenkel, together with the axiom of choice (a system
    commonly abbreviated as ZFC) are able to prove the validity of the law of
    the excluded middle. That is, if ZFC is consistent, then so is the law of
    the excluded middle. This is one of the reasons for studying ZFC in detail.
    \par\hfill\par
    The first collection of axioms were proposed in 1908 by
    Ernst Zermelo\index{Zermelo, Ernst}. Subtle problems were pointed out by
    Abraham Fraenkel\index{Fraenkel, Abraham} in 1920, and in 1921 the system of
    Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory\index{Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory} came to be.
    The requirement that a set does not contain itself is sufficient to avoid
    Russell's paradox. This is equivalent to the
    \textit{axiom of regularity}\index{Axiom!of Regularity}. We will prove the
    equivalence of this axiom with our definition once we have obtained the law
    of the excluded middle.
    \subsection{Subsets and Equality}
        To delve more into set theory it would be convenient to know that at
        least \textit{one} set exists. The axiom of the empty
        set\index{Axiom!of the Empty Set} gives us such an existance.
        \begin{faxiom}{Axiom of the Empty Set}{Axiom_of_the_Empty_Set}
            There exists a set $\emptyset$ (the \gls{empty set}) such that for
            all $x$ it is true that $x\notin\emptyset$.\index{Empty Set}
            \begin{equation*}
                \exists_{\emptyset}:\forall_{x}\big(\neg(x\in\emptyset)\big)
            \end{equation*}
        \end{faxiom}
        The empty set is the set that contains no elements. As such, some choose
        to write $\emptyset=\{\}$. Note that the empty set is different from the
        set $\{\emptyset\}$. The empty set contains no elements whereas
        $\{\emptyset\}$ contains one elements (it contains the empty set).
        Indeed, the equality of $\emptyset$ and $\{\emptyset\}$ would violate
        our requirement that sets do not contain themselves. Any set that
        contains \textit{something} is called non-empty.
        \begin{fdefinition}{Non-Empty Set}{Non_Empty_Set}
            A \gls{non-empty set} is a \gls{set} $A$ such that there exists an
            $x$ such that $x\in{A}$.\index{Non-Empty Set}
        \end{fdefinition}
        \begin{example}
            The terminology is somewhat redundant, and essentially every set we
            deal with is non-empty. Indeed, there is only one empty set
            (see Thm.~\ref{thm:Empty_Set_is_Unique}). Thus, every other set one
            thinks of ($\mathbb{N},\mathbb{Z},\mathbb{Q},\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}$,
            etc.) is non-empty.
        \end{example}
        \begin{example}
            It's possible to write down some formula for a set that ultimately
            leads to the empty set. For consider the \textit{set of all}
            \textit{rational numbers whose square is two}. This set turns out to
            be empty since there is no rational that satisfies this criterion.
            That is, $\sqrt{2}$ is known to be an irrational number. Thus, the
            set specified by our proposition is the empty set.
        \end{example}
        \begin{example}
            Going in the other direction, it is possible to write a formula for
            a set that appears empty, but is indeed not. The set of all
            $p\textrm{-Sylow}$ subgroups\index{Sylow Subgroups} of a non-empty
            finite group (Discussed in Book~\ref{book:Algebra}) is a non-empty
            set, but there's no reason to believe so from the start.
        \end{example}
        A set is entirely determined by its elements, and as such repetition and
        order cannot be accounted for. That is, the sets $\{a,b\}$ and
        $\{a,a,b\}$ must be considered the same since they contain precisely the
        same elements. This will be made clear once equality has been defined.
        In a similar manner, sets have no sense of order and thus $\{a,b\}$ and
        $\{b,a\}$ are equivalent. It then becomes a task to invent some new
        object that does have a notion of order. To do this requires the concept
        of a \textit{function}\index{Function}, and it is our current aim to
        develop this topic.
        \par\hfill\par
        To rigorously show that the examples in the previous paragraph are equal
        requires a definition of equality. This is the
        \textit{axiom of extensionality}\index{Axiom!of Extensionality}. First,
        we define the familiar symbol for equality\index{Equality} in terms of
        containment.
        \begin{fnotation}{Equality}{Equality}
            If $A$ and $B$ are sets, then $A=B$ if and only if for all sets
            $C$, $C\in{A}$ if and only if $C\in{B}$, and for all sets $D$,
            $A\in{D}$ if and only if $B\in{D}$.
            \begin{equation*}
                \forall_{A}\forall_{B}(A=B)
                \Longleftrightarrow\Big(
                    \forall_{C}(C\in{A}\Leftrightarrow{C}\in{B})
                    \land\forall_{D}(A\in{D}\Leftrightarrow{B}\in{D})\Big)
            \end{equation*}
        \end{fnotation}
        \begin{example}
            Consider the set of all planets in the solar system, and consider
            the set of the eight largest objects in the solar system other than
            the sun. These two sets are equal since the eight largest objects
            (other than the sun) are the eight planets (sorry Pluto), and the
            set of planets form the eight largest objects. The tricky part is
            to check that for any set one can name, it is true that if the set
            of planets lies in the set, then the set of the eight largest
            objects not equal to the sun lie in this set as well, and vice
            versa. This is almost an impossible task, and so we rely on the
            \textit{axiom of extensionality} the demonstration of equality.
        \end{example} 
        The axiom of extensionality says that to check for equality it suffices
        to show that for all $C$, $C\in{A}$ if and only if $C\in{B}$.
        That is, there is no need to check that for all $D$, $A\in{D}$ if and
        only if $B\in{D}$. For simplicity, the axiom of extensionality may be
        taken as the definition of equality.
        \begin{faxiom}{Axiom of Extensionality}{Axiom_of_Extensionality}
            If $A$ and $B$ are sets, and if for all $x$ it is true that
            $x\in{A}$ if and only if $x\in{B}$, then $A=B$. That is, $A$ and $B$
            are equal sets.\index{Axiom!of Extensionality}
            \begin{equation*}
                \forall_{x}\forall_{y}\Big(\forall_{z}(z\in{x}\Leftrightarrow
                z\in{y})\Longleftrightarrow\big(x=y\big)\Big)
            \end{equation*}
        \end{faxiom}
        \begin{example}
            Returning to our example of planets, we have seen that the set of
            all planets and the set of the eight largest objects other than the
            sun contain precisely the same elements. By the axiom of
            extensionality, we thus have equality amongst these two.
        \end{example}
        We won't adopt this axiom directly, but restate equality as a definition
        using the language of subsets\index{Set!Subset}. This will make proving
        various things easier in the proceeding sections. The notions are
        equivalent. Subsets are sets that are defined in terms of another given
        set by simply removing some (or none, or all) of the elements.
        \begin{fdefinition}{Subsets}{Subsets}
            A \gls{subset} of a \gls{set} $B$ is a set $A$ such that for all
            $x\in{A}$ it is true that $x\in{B}$. If $A$ is a subset of $B$ we
            write $A\subseteq{B}$. Otherwise, we write $A\nsubseteq{B}$.
            \index{Subset}
            \begin{equation*}
                \forall_{A}\forall_{B}\Big(\big(A\subseteq{B}\big)
                \Longleftrightarrow
                \forall_{x}\big(x\in{A}\Rightarrow{x}\in{B}\big)\Big)
            \end{equation*}
        \end{fdefinition}
        We can often visualize sets as blobs in the plane. Using such a visual,
        we can envision subsets as well (Fig.~\ref{fig:Subset_Blobs}). Given a
        blob $B$, a subset of $B$ is another blob $A$ that is entirely contained
        within $B$.
        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \input{tikz/Blobs_Subset_Example_001.tex}
            \caption{Visualizing Subsets as Blobs}
            \label{fig:Subset_Blobs}
        \end{figure}
        \begin{example}
            Consider the set of natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$ and the set of
            integers $\mathbb{Z}$ (loosely defined in
            Eqn.~\ref{eqn:Natural_Numbers_Ellipses} and
            Eqn.~\ref{eqn:Integers_Ellipses}, respectively). It can be seen that
            every natural number is also an integer, and thus we have:
            \begin{equation}
                \mathbb{N}\subseteq\mathbb{Z}
            \end{equation}
            Letting $\mathbb{Q}$ denote the rational numbers $p/q$, where
            $p,q\in\mathbb{Z}$ and $q$ is non-zero, we can see that $\mathbb{Q}$
            contains $\mathbb{Z}$ as a subset. That is, setting $q=1$ and
            allowing $p$ to vary over $\mathbb{Z}$ gives us every integer. Thus:
            \begin{equation}
                \mathbb{Z}\subseteq\mathbb{Q}
            \end{equation}
            We can continue with the real numbers and the complex numbers as
            well, creating a chain of subsets:
            \begin{equation}
                \mathbb{N}\subseteq\mathbb{Z}\subseteq\mathbb{Q}
                \subseteq\mathbb{R}\subseteq\mathbb{C}
            \end{equation}
        \end{example}
        We can use subsets to define equality and to provide examples
        of the \textit{axiom schema of specification}%
        \index{Axiom!Schema of Specification}. It is important to note the
        distinction between the symbols $\in$ and $\subseteq$. The symbol $\in$
        is used to denote that some object $x$ is an \textit{element}%
        \index{Element (Sets)} of some set. That is, $x\in{A}$ indicates that
        $x$ is an element of $A$. This does not necessarily imply
        $x\subseteq{A}$, but this \textit{does} imply that $\{x\}\subseteq{A}$.
        That is, if $x\in{A}$, then the set that contains only $x$ is a subset
        of $A$. Moreover, the notions are not mutually exclusive. It is possible
        for $A$ to be a set such that $x\in{A}$ and $x\subseteq{A}$. For let
        $A=\{\emptyset\}$. For any set $A$ it is true that
        $\emptyset\subseteq{A}$ (see Thm.~\ref{thm:Emptyset_Is_Subset}). But
        from how $A$ is defined, we have that $\emptyset\in{A}$. Thus it is true
        that both $\emptyset\in{A}$ and $\emptyset\subseteq{A}$.

            This is true since from the definition of $A$ and $B$, every element
            of $A$ is also an element of $B$. The converse of this is not true
            since there is an element of $B$ that is not an element of $A$
            (namely, the element $d$). That is, $d\in{B}$ but $d\notin{A}$ and
            therefore $B\nsubseteq{A}$.
        \end{fexample}
        The example shown in Ex.~\ref{ex:Elementary_Examples_of_Subsets} shows
        how we can define equality of sets. We see that $A\subseteq{B}$, but
        $B\nsubseteq{A}$. If we have two sets $A$ and $B$ such that
        $A\subseteq{B}$ and $B\subseteq{A}$ then it would be impossible to
        discern between the two. This gives us our new definition of equality.
        We now prove this equivalence with the axiom of extensionality%
        \index{Axiom!of Extensionality} (Ax.~\ref{ax:Axiom_of_Extensionality}).
        \begin{theorem}
            \label{thm:Equivalent_Def_of_Equality}%
            If $A$ and $B$ are sets, then $A=B$ if and only if $A\subseteq{B}$
            and $B\subseteq{A}$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            For by the axiom of extensionality
            (Ax.~\ref{ax:Axiom_of_Extensionality}), $A=B$ if and only if, for
            all $x$ it is true that $x\in{A}$ if and only if $x\in{B}$. But then
            $x\in{A}$ implies that $x\in{B}$, and thus $A\subseteq{B}$
            (Def.~\ref{def:Subsets}). But also $x\in{B}$ implies $x\in{A}$, and
            therefore $B\subseteq{A}$. Moreover, if $A\subseteq{B}$ and
            $B\subseteq{A}$, then for all $x\in{A}$ it is true that $x\in{B}$
            and for all $x\in{B}$ it is true that $x\in{A}$
            (Def.~\ref{def:Subsets}), and therefore $x\in{A}$ if and only if
            $x\in{B}$. Thus, $A=B$ if and only if $A\subseteq{B}$ and
            $B\subseteq{A}$.
        \end{proof}
        With this, we can redefine the notion of
        \textit{equal sets}\index{Equal Sets}.
        \begin{fdefinition}{Equal Sets}{Equal_Sets}
            \Glspl{equal set} are \glspl{set} $A$ and $B$, denoted $A=B$, such
            that $A\subseteq{B}$ and $B\subseteq{A}$.\index{Equal Sets}
            \begin{equation*}
                \forall_{A}\forall_{B}(A=B)

                (A\subseteq{B}\land{B}\subseteq{A})
            \end{equation*}
        \end{fdefinition}
        Def.~\ref{def:Equal_Sets} is justified by
        Thm.~\ref{thm:Equivalent_Def_of_Equality}, and thus there is no
        contradiction with the axiom of extensionality
        (Ax.~\ref{ax:Axiom_of_Extensionality}). If $A$ and $B$ are not equal, we
        write $A\ne{B}$.

            This is because every element of $\mathbb{Z}_{3}$ is contained in
            $\mathbb{Z}_{4}$, but $3\in\mathbb{Z}_{4}$ but
            $3\notin\mathbb{Z}_{3}$. It may seem like bad notation to write
            $3\notin\mathbb{Z}_{3}$, but since we want $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ to have
            $n$ elements, and since we started counting at zero, we have that
            $n\notin\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$. Such counting
            schemes are common in computer science, but there's disagreement in
            mathematics as to whether $0\in\mathbb{N}$ or not. We will use the
            \textit{axiom of infinity}\index{Axiom!of Infinity} to prove the
            existence of $\mathbb{N}$, and in doing so it will be natural to
            define $\mathbb{N}$ as a set that contains $0$.

        While Def.~\ref{def:Equal_Sets} is indeed equivalent to the axiom of
        extensionality, this definition creates a few problems. As discussed
        previously, sets have no notion of order and cannot account for
        repetition. For let $A$, $B$, and $C$ be the sets defined by:

        All three of these sets are equal by both the definition of equality
        (Def.~\ref{def:Equal_Sets})\index{Equal Sets} and the axiom of
        extensionality\index{Axiom!of Extensionality}. It seems clear that
        $A\subseteq{B}$, but it is also true that $B\subseteq{A}$. This is
        because $B$ contains only the elements $a$ and $b$. While $a$ is
        included twice, repetition cannot be accounted for and $B$ is entirely
        determined by $a$ and $b$. But $A$ also contains $a$ and $b$, and
        therefire $B\subseteq{A}$. By the definition of equality
        (Def.~\ref{def:Equal_Sets}), we have that $A=B$. In a similar manner,
        $A=C$. From the definition of subsets, for any set $A$ we see that
        $A\subseteq{A}$ (see Thm.~\ref{thm:Reflexivity_of_Inclusion}). It would
        be nice to distinguish between subsets that aren't the entire set
        itself. These are called proper subsets\index{Set!Subset!Proper}, and
        we can define them in terms of equality.
        \begin{fdefinition}{Proper Subsets}{Proper_Subsets}
            A \gls{proper subset} of a \gls{set} $B$ is a set $A$ such that
            $A\subseteq{B}$ and $A\ne{B}$. We write $A\subsetneq{B}$
            to denote that $A$ is a proper subset of $B$.\index{Proper Subset}
            \begin{equation*}
                \forall_{A}\forall_{B}(A\subsetneq{B})

            \end{equation*}
        \end{fdefinition}
        The symbols $\subseteq$ and $\subsetneq$ are analogous to the notations
        of inequalities that one finds in calculus: $\leq$ and $<$. In many
        texts, the two symbols $\subseteq$ and $\subset$ are taken to be
        identical, which may cause confusion. In an attempt to reduce confusion,
        $\subseteq$ will denote any subset, $\subsetneq$ denotes a proper
        subset, and the symbol $\subset$ will be avoided.
        \begin{lexample}{Proper Subsets}{Proper_Subsets}
            Let $A$ and $B$ be sets defined as follows:

            \end{subequations}
            \par\vspace{2.5ex}
            Then $A\subseteq{B}$, since every element of $A$ is an element of
            $B$, but $B\nsubseteq{A}$ since $d\in{B}$ and $d\notin{A}$.
            Therefore $A\ne{B}$, and thus $A$ is a proper subset of $B$. We can
            denote this by writing $A\subsetneq{B}$.
        \end{lexample}
        \begin{example}
            Returning to more concrete examples, $\mathbb{N}$ is a proper subset
            of $\mathbb{Z}$. To see this, note that $\minus{1}\in\mathbb{Z}$ but
            $\minus{1}\notin\mathbb{N}$. Indeed, none of the negative integers
            are natural numbers, but they are integers. We can write this by:
            \begin{equation}
                \mathbb{N}\subsetneq\mathbb{Z}
            \end{equation}
            Similarly, $\mathbb{Q}$ contains numbers that are not integers,
            for example $1/2$. Thus, $\mathbb{Z}$ is also a proper subset of
            $\mathbb{Q}$. Lastly, since $\sqrt{2}$ is not a rational number, the
            set of rational numbers must then be a proper subset of the set of
            real numbers.
        \end{example}
        We now introduce the \textit{axiom schema of specification}.
        \begin{faxiom}{Axiom Schema of Specification}
                      {Axiom_Schema_of_Specification}
            If $A$ is a set and if $P$ is a proposition, then there exists a set
            $B$ such that $x\in{B}$ if and only if $x\in{A}$ and $P(x)$ is true.
            We can write this as:\index{Axiom!Schema of Specification}
            \begin{equation*}
                B=\big\{\,x\in{A}\;|\;P(x)\,\big\}
            \end{equation*}
            Using our formal language, we have:
            \begin{equation*}
                \forall_{A}\forall_{P}\exists_{B}:
                \forall_{x}\Big(x\in{B}\Leftrightarrow
                \big(x\in{A}\land{P}(x)\big)\Big)
            \end{equation*}
        \end{faxiom}
        Ax.~\ref{ax:Axiom_Schema_of_Specification} is different from the
        inconsistent axiom of unrestricted comprehension%
        \index{Axiom!of Unrestricted Comprehension} in that we can only speak of
        elements that are already defined and contained in some other set. That
        is, this new axiom does not allow us to talk about the
        \textit{set of all sets}\index{Set!of All Sets}, and so we have avoided
        the crux of Russell's paradox.
        \par\hfill\par
        This allows us to use the Set-Builder method of constructing sets. We
        loosely defined then natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$ and the integers
        $\mathbb{Z}$ (From the German \textit{Zahl}) by
        Eqns.~\ref{eqn:Natural_Numbers_Ellipses} and
        \ref{eqn:Integers_Ellipses}, respectively. It would be more
        difficult (but not impossible) to describe the set of rational numbers%
        \index{Rational Numbers} in such a way. Instead, we use set builder
        notation if it is known that $\mathbb{Q}$ is contained in some larger
        set $\mathbb{R}$ (the \textit{real} numbers)\index{Real Numbers}.
        \begin{equation}
            \mathbb{Q}=\Big\{\;\frac{p}{q}\in\mathbb{R}\;\big|\;
                                p,\,q\in\mathbb{Z}\textrm{ and }q\ne{0}\;\Big\}
        \end{equation}
        That is, the rational numbers are the set of all real numbers which can
        be written as the ratios of integers with non-zero denominator. The
        Axiom Schema of Specification states that this is is a valid method of
        describing sets. It is also known as the axiom of separation%
        \index{Axiom!of Separation}.
        \begin{example}
            We can describe the sets $\mathbb{Z}$, $\mathbb{N}$,
            $\mathbb{N}_{e}$, and $\mathbb{N}_{o}$ using set-builder notation if
            we assume these belong to some larger set $\mathbb{R}$. We define
            $\mathbb{Z}$ by:
            \index{Natural Numbers}\index{Even Integers}\index{Odd Integers}%
            \index{Integers}
            \begin{equation}
                \mathbb{Z}=
                \big\{\,n\in\mathbb{R}\;|\;n\textrm{ is an integer}\,\big\}
            \end{equation}
            From here we can define $\mathbb{N}$ by:
            \begin{equation}
                \mathbb{N}=\{\,n\in\mathbb{Z}\;|\;n\geq{0}\,\}
            \end{equation}
            Furthermore, $\mathbb{N}_{e}$ and $\mathbb{N}_{0}$ can be described
            as follows:

        We are not adopting these definitions since they lack rigor. These
        examples build intuition behind the notation and the axioms, but we will
        develop arithmetic from an axiomatic viewpoint.
    \subsection{Ordered Pairs and Unions}
        We now wish to solve the issue previously raised that sets do
        not have order. We'll develop a new object, called ordered pairs%
        \index{Ordered Pair}, that can distinguish such things. The definition
        we'll adopt is due to Kuratowski\index{Kuratowski, Kazimierz} and uses
        the following form:
        \begin{equation}
            (a,\,b)=\Big\{\,\big\{\,a\,\big\},\,\big\{\,a,\,b\,\big\}\,\Big\}
        \end{equation}
        We now prove such a set exists within the framework of ZFC.
        \begin{faxiom}{Axiom of Pairing}{Axiom_of_Pairing}
            If $A$ and $B$ are sets, then there exists a set $\mathcal{C}$
            such that $A\in\mathcal{C}$ and $B\in\mathcal{C}$.
            \index{Axiom!of Pairing}
            \begin{equation*}
                \forall_{A}\forall_{B}\exists_{\mathcal{C}}:
                (A\in\mathcal{C}\land{B}\in\mathcal{C})
            \end{equation*}
        \end{faxiom}
        The set hypothesized to exist in this axiom may be very large, we have
        no way of knowing. What we want from this is a set that contains two
        elements $A$ and $B$, and only those elements. We obtain this by
        combining pairing with specification.
        \begin{theorem}
            \label{thm:Existence_of_Set_Built_from_Two_Sets}%
            If $A$ and $B$ are sets, then there exists a set $D$ such that,
            for all $x$ it is true that $x\in{D}$ if and only if $x=A$ or
            $x=B$. That is:
            \begin{equation}
                D=\{\,A,\,B\,\}
            \end{equation}
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            By the axiom of pairing (Ax.~\ref{ax:Axiom_of_Pairing}) there
            exists a set $\mathcal{C}$ such that $A\in\mathcal{C}$ and
            $B\in\mathcal{C}$. Let $P$ be the proposition
            \textit{true if} $x=A$ \textit{or} $x=B$, \textit{false otherwise}.
            By the axiom schema of specification
            (Ax.~\ref{ax:Axiom_Schema_of_Specification}), there is a set
            $D$ such that $x\in{D}$ if and only if $x\in\mathcal{C}$ and
            $P(x)$ is true. But then $x\in{D}$ if and only if
            $x\in\mathcal{C}$ and $x=A$ or $x\in\mathcal{C}$ and $x=B$.
            But $A\in\mathcal{C}$ and $B\in\mathcal{C}$, and thus
            $x\in{D}$ if and only if $x=A$ or $x=B$.
        \end{proof}
        By the axiom of extensionality\index{Axiom!of Extensionality}
        (Ax.~\ref{ax:Axiom_of_Extensionality}), the set hypothesized in
        Thm.~\ref{thm:Existence_of_Set_Built_from_Two_Sets} is unique, and thus
        there is no trouble in \textit{defining} the symbol $\{A,B\}$ to be the
        unique set that contains the elements $A$ and $B$ and only those
        elements. That is, we develop the new notation:
        \begin{fnotation}{Finite Set Notation}{Finite_Set_Notation}
            If $A$ and $B$ are sets, then $\{A,B\}$ is the unique set such that
            for all $x$, $x\in\{A,B\}$ if and only if $x=A$ or $x=B$.
            \begin{equation*}
                \forall_{x}\Big(\big(x\in\{A,B\}\big)
                \Leftrightarrow\big((x=A)\lor(x=B)\big)\Big)
            \end{equation*}
        \end{fnotation}
        \begin{theorem}
            \label{thm:Existence_of_Set_Containing_Set}%
            If $A$ is a set, then there is a set $B$ such that $x\in{B}$ if
            and only if $x=A$. That is, there exists a set $B$ such that:
            \begin{equation}
                B=\{\,A\,\}
            \end{equation}
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            For since $A$ is a set, by
            Thm.~\ref{thm:Existence_of_Set_Built_from_Two_Sets} there exists
            a set $B=\{A,\,A\}$. But then $x\in{B}$ if and only if $x=A$.
        \end{proof}
        We can apply Not.~\ref{not:Finite_Set_Notation} to a single set $A$ and
        similarly define what the notation $\{A\}$ means. With this, we can now
        prove the existence of ordered pairs.
        \begin{ltheorem}{Existence of Ordered Pairs}{Existence_of_Ordered_Pairs}
            If $A$ and $B$ are sets, then there is a set $(A,\,B)$ such that,
            for all $x$ it is true that $x\in(A,\,B)$ if only if $x=\{A\}$
            or $x=\{A,B\}$.
        \end{ltheorem}
        \begin{proof}
            For by Thm.~\ref{thm:Existence_of_Set_Containing_Set}, there is
            a set $\{A\}$ such that $x\in\{A\}$ if and only if $x=A$.
            But by Thm.~\ref{thm:Existence_of_Set_Built_from_Two_Sets}, there
            is a set $\{A,\,B\}$ such that $x\in\{A,\,B\}$ and if only
            if $x=A$ or $x=B$. But again by
            Thm.~\ref{thm:Existence_of_Set_Built_from_Two_Sets}, since
            $\{A\}$ and $\{A,\,B\}$ are sets, there is a set $(A,\,B)$ such
            that $x\in(A,\,B)$ if and only if $x=\{A\}$ or $x=\{A,\,B\}$.
        \end{proof}
        Thm.~\ref{thm:Existence_of_Ordered_Pairs} asserts the existence of
        ordered pairs\index{Ordered Pair}, as defined by Kuratowski, and allows
        us to provide the following definition.
        \begin{fdefinition}{Ordered Pairs}{Ordered_Pairs}
            The \gls{ordered pair} of a \gls{set} $x$ with respect to a set
            $y$ is the set:\index{Ordered Pair}
            \begin{equation*}
                (x,\,y)=\big\{\,\{\,x\,\},\,\{\,x,\,y\,\}\,\big\}
            \end{equation*}
        \end{fdefinition}
        Kuratowski\index{Kuratowski, Kazimierz} first put forward this definition
        in 1921 and this does precisely what we want it to do and orders
        elements. That is, if $x$ and $y$ are distinct, then
        $(x,\,y)\ne(y,\,x)$. The caveat with this definition is the following
        reduction:
        \begin{equation}
            (x,\,x)
            =\big\{\,\{\,x\,\},\,\{\,x,\,x\,\}\,\big\}
            =\big\{\,\{\,x\,\},\{\,x\,\}\,\big\}
            =\big\{\,\{\,x\,\}\,\big\}
        \end{equation}
        Prior to Kuratowski there existed a definition due to Norbert Wiener%
        \index{Wiener, Norbert}, put forward in 1914. His definition grew out of
        Bertrand Russell's\index{Russell, Bertrand} Type
        Theory\index{Type Theory} which was an attempt to rid set theory of the
        paradoxes he discovered. Wiener writes:
        \begin{equation}
            (x,\,y)_{W}=\Big\{\,\big\{\,\{\,x\,\},\,\emptyset\,\big\},\,
                                \big\{\,\{\,y\,\}\,\big\}\Big\}
        \end{equation}
        Returning to Kuratowski's definition (Def.~\ref{def:Ordered_Pairs}),
        consider the ordered pair $(1,\,2)$, where we take for granted that
        $1\ne{2}$. We have:
        \begin{equation}
            (1,\,2)=\big\{\,\{\,1\,\},\,\{\,1,\,2\,\}\,\big\}
        \end{equation}
        Swapping and computing $(2,\,1)$, we obtain:
        \begin{equation}
            (2,\,1)=\big\{\,\{\,2\,\},\,\{\,2,\,1\,\}\,\big\}
        \end{equation}
        We know that sets cannot distinguish order, so
        $\{\,1,\,2\,\}=\{\,2,\,1\,\}$. Thus:
        \par
        \begin{subequations}
            \begin{minipage}[b]{0.49\textwidth}
                \begin{equation}
                    (1,\,2)=\big\{\,\{\,1\,\},\,\{\,1,\,2\,\}\,\big\}
                \end{equation}
            \end{minipage}
            \hfill
            \begin{minipage}[b]{0.49\textwidth}
                \begin{equation}
                    (2,\,1)=\big\{\,\{\,2\,\},\,\{\,1,\,2\,\}\,\big\}
                \end{equation}
            \end{minipage}
        \end{subequations}
        \par\vspace{2.5ex}
        Combining these equations, we now have that:
        \begin{equation}
            (1,\,2)\ne(2,\,1)
        \end{equation}
        To see this, note that both sets contain the element $\{1,\,2\}$, but
        $\{1\}$ is an element of $(1,\,2)$ and not an element of $(2,\,1)$,
        and thus $(1,\,2)\nsubseteq(2,\,1)$. Similarly, $\{2\}$ is an element
        of $(2,\,1)$ but not an element of $(1,\,2)$, and therefore
        $(2,\,1)\nsubseteq(1,\,2)$. From the definition of equality
        (Def.~\ref{def:Equal_Sets}), we have that these sets are not equal.
        \par\hfill\par
        There's is an unfortunate doubling of notation that occurs in
        mathematics, and $(a,b)$ has two common meanings. The first meaning is
        the ordered pair which we've just defined, and the second is the
        \textit{open interval}\index{Open Interval} defined in the context of a
        \textit{partially ordered set}\index{Partially Ordered Set}.
        The most common example is when discussing the real numbers
        $\mathbb{R}$, $(a,b)$ denotes the set of all real numbers $x$ such that
        $a<x$ and $x<b$. Hopefully it will be clear what the notation means when
        a theorem or example is being presented, but we will be explicit when
        ambiguity can arise.
        \par\hfill\par
        The natural thing from here is to construct the
        \textit{Cartesian Product}\index{Cartesian Product} of two sets. This is
        the set of all ordered pairs\index{Ordered Pair} $(a,\,b)$ where $a$
        belongs to some set $A$ and $b$ belongs to another set $B$. To prove
        such a set exists requires two more axioms.
        \begin{faxiom}{Axiom of Union}{Axiom_of_Union}
            If $\mathcal{O}$ is a set, then there exists a set $\mathcal{F}$
            such that, for all $A$ such that $A\in\mathcal{O}$ and for all
            $x$ such that $x\in{A}$, it is true that $x\in\mathcal{F}$.%
            \index{Axiom!of Union}
            \begin{equation*}
                \forall_{\mathcal{O}}\exists_{\mathcal{F}}\forall_{x}:
                \big(\exists_{A\in\mathcal{O}}(x\in{A})\big)
                \Rightarrow{x}\in\mathcal{F}
            \end{equation*}
        \end{faxiom}
        This states that, given a collection of sets $\mathcal{O}$, there exists
        a larger set which contains the elements of the constituent sets of
        $\mathcal{O}$. One question that arises is
        \textit{what happens if our collection is empty}? That is, if
        $\mathcal{O}=\emptyset$, is there any meaning behind the equation
        (the notation $\cup$ is defined in Def.~\ref{def:Union_over_a_Set}):
        \begin{equation}
            \mathcal{F}=\bigcup_{\mathcal{U}\in\mathcal{O}}\mathcal{U}
        \end{equation}
        There is, and $\mathcal{F}$ will be the empty set. That is,
        $\mathcal{F}=\emptyset$. This is true in a vacuous sense and can be
        proved via contradiction with the law of the excluded middle.
        \begin{ltheorem}{Existence of the Union of Sets}{Existence_of_Unions}
            If $\mathcal{O}$ is a set, then there exists a set $\mathcal{F}$
            such that, for all $x$ it is true that $x\in\mathcal{F}$ if and
            only if there is a set $A\in\mathcal{O}$ such that $x\in{A}$.
        \end{ltheorem}
        \begin{proof}
            For by the axiom of union (Ax.~\ref{ax:Axiom_of_Union}), there
            exists a set $\mathcal{A}$ such that, for all $A\in\mathcal{O}$
            and for all $x\in{A}$, it is true that $x\in\mathcal{A}$. Let
            $P$ be the proposition \textit{true if there exists a set}
            $A\in\mathcal{O}$ \textit{such that} $x\in{A}$,
            \textit{false otherwise}. Then, by the axiom schema of specification
            (Ax.~\ref{ax:Axiom_Schema_of_Specification}) there exists a set
            $\mathcal{F}$ such that:
            \begin{equation}
                \mathcal{F}=\big\{\,x\in\mathcal{A}\;|\;P(x)\,\big\}
            \end{equation}
            But then $x\in\mathcal{F}$ if and only if $x\in\mathcal{A}$ and
            $P(x)$ is true. But if $P(x)$ is true, then $x\in\mathcal{A}$, and
            thus $x\in\mathcal{F}$ if and only if there is a set
            $A\in\mathcal{O}$ such that $x\in{A}$.
        \end{proof}
        We define the set $\mathcal{F}$ described in
        Thm.~\ref{thm:Existence_of_Unions} as the \textit{union}%
        \index{Union (Sets)} over the set $\mathcal{O}$. This set is often
        called the index set\index{Index Set} for which we take the union over.
        \begin{fdefinition}{Union over a Set}{Union_over_a_Set}
            The \gls{union over a set} $\mathcal{O}$ is the set:
            \index{Union (Sets)}
            \begin{equation*}
                \bigcup_{\mathcal{U}\in\mathcal{O}}\mathcal{U}
                =\big\{\,x\;|\;\textrm{There exists a set }
                         \mathcal{U}\in\mathcal{O}\textrm{ such that }
                         x\in\mathcal{U}\big\}
            \end{equation*}
            Using our formal language:
            \begin{equation*}
                \forall_{x}\Big(
                    x\in\bigcup_{\mathcal{U}\in\mathcal{O}}\mathcal{U}
                    \Leftrightarrow\exists_{\mathcal{U}\in\mathcal{O}}:
                    x\in\mathcal{U}\Big)
            \end{equation*}
        \end{fdefinition}
        This is very convenient if we have a collection of sets defined, but it
        would be nice to form the union over two given sets without considering
        them as part of a larger collection. This can be done by combining the
        axiom of union\index{Axiom!of Union} with
        pairing\index{Axiom!of Pairing}.
        \begin{theorem}
            \label{thm:Union_of_Two_Sets_Exists}%
            If $A$ and $B$ are sets, then there exists a set $C$ such that
            $x\in{C}$ if and only if either $x\in{A}$ or $x\in{B}$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            For by Thm.~\ref{thm:Existence_of_Set_Built_from_Two_Sets},
            there exists a set $\mathcal{O}$ such that $y\in\mathcal{O}$ if and
            only if $y=A$ or $y=B$. That is, $\mathcal{O}=\{A,\,B\}$.
            But by Thm.~\ref{thm:Existence_of_Unions} there exists a set
            $C$ such that $x\in{C}$ if and only if there exist a set
            $F\in\mathcal{O}$ such that $x\in{F}$. But then $x\in{C}$ if and
            only if either $x\in{A}$ or $x\in{B}$.
        \end{proof}
        This allows us to define our first \textit{operation} of two sets.
        \begin{fdefinition}{Union of Two Sets}{Union_of_Two_Sets}
            The \gls{union of two sets} $A$ and $B$ is the set $A\cup{B}$
            defined by:
            \begin{equation*}
                A\cup{B}=\big\{\,x\;|\;x\in{A}\textrm{ or }x\in{B}\,\big\}
            \end{equation*}
        \end{fdefinition}
        In our definition of the union over a set and the union of two sets
        we have slightly abused our set-builder notation. The axiom schema
        of specification allows us to write a set as
        $A=\{\,x\in{B}\,|\,P(x)\,\}$, given some set $B$ that is already known
        to exists, and some proposition $P$. These two definitions
        (Def.~\ref{def:Union_over_a_Set} and \ref{def:Union_of_Two_Sets})
        are justified by the theorems we have proven, and so there is no
        contradiction.
        \begin{example}
            Again using the notation found in Eqn.~\ref{eqn:Z_n_Ellipses}, if we
            let $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ denote the integers between $0$ and $n-1$, we
            have the following: If $n$ is less than $m$, then:
            \begin{equation}
                \mathbb{Z}_{n}\cup\mathbb{Z}_{m}=\mathbb{Z}_{m}
            \end{equation}
            This is because every element of $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ is already
            and element of $\mathbb{Z}_{m}$, and thus taking the union adds
            nothing new to $\mathbb{Z}_{m}$, so the resulting set is
            $\mathbb{Z}_{m}$ itself.
        \end{example}
        \begin{example}
            Denoting the even and odd non-negative integers by $\mathbb{N}_{e}$
            and $\mathbb{N}_{o}$, respectively, we see that:
            \begin{equation}
                \mathbb{N}_{e}\cup\mathbb{N}_{o}=\mathbb{N}
            \end{equation}
            This is because every non-negative integer $n\in\mathbb{N}$ is
            either even or odd, and thus either $n\in\mathbb{N}_{e}$ or
            $n\in\mathbb{N}_{o}$. Taking the union therefore gives the entire
            set $\mathbb{N}$. The union does not add anything more than
            $\mathbb{N}$ since $\mathbb{N}_{e}\subseteq\mathbb{N}$ and
            $\mathbb{N}_{o}\subseteq\mathbb{N}$.

            The union of $A$ and $B$ is the set that contains all of the
            elements of $A$ and all of the elements of $B$, and only such
            elements. That is:
            \begin{equation}
                A\cup{B}=\{\,a,\,b,\,c,\,1,\,2\,\}
            \end{equation}
            Even though $c\in{A}$ and $c\in{B}$, $c$ only appears once in the
            union. This is because sets cannot account for repetition, so
            including $c$ twice would be redundant.
        \end{fexample}
        The union of two sets can again be visualized by considering blobs
        in the plane. Let $A$ and $B$ be two circles that overlap somewhere in
        the middle. The union $A\cup{B}$ can then be represented by shading in
        the region covered by either $A$ or $B$
        (see Fig.~\ref{fig:Union_of_Two_Sets}). Such a drawing is called a
        \textit{Venn diagram}.

        Fig.~\ref{fig:Union_of_Three_Sets}. We can combine the axiom schema of
        specification (Ax.~\ref{ax:Axiom_Schema_of_Specification}) with the
        existence of the union of two sets to define intersections.

            If $A$ and $B$ are sets, then there exists a set $\mathcal{C}$

            only if $x\in{A}$ and $x\in{B}$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            For by Thm.~\ref{thm:Union_of_Two_Sets_Exists}, there exists
            a set $A\cup{B}$ such that, for all $x$ is is true that
            $x\in{A}\cup{B}$ if and only if $x\in{A}$ or $x\in{B}$. Let
            $P$ be the proposition \textit{True if} $x\in{A}$ \textit{and}
            $x\in{B}$, \textit{false otherwise}. Then by the axiom schema
            of specification (Ax.~\ref{ax:Axiom_Schema_of_Specification})
            there is a set $\mathcal{C}$ such that:
            \begin{equation}
                \mathcal{C}=\big\{\,x\in{A}\cup{B}\;|\;P(x)\,\big\}
            \end{equation}
            But then $x\in\mathcal{C}$ if and only if $x\in{A}\cup{B}$ and
            $x\in{A}$ and $x\in{B}$. But if $x\in{A}$ and $x\in{B}$, then
            $x\in{A}$, and thus $x\in{A}\cup{B}$
            (Def.~\ref{def:Union_of_Two_Sets}). That is, $P(x)$ implies that
            $x\in{A}\cup{C}$. Therefore, $x\in\mathcal{C}$
            if and only if $x\in{A}$ and $x\in{B}$.

            The \gls{intersection of two sets} $A$ and $B$ is the set:

                =\big\{\,x\in{A}\cup{B}\;|\;

            \end{equation*}
        \end{fdefinition}
        We'll need one brief theorem about intersections to allow us to prove
        that certain sets are not equal.
        \begin{theorem}
            \label{thm:Lemma_for_Anti_Russells_Paradox}%
            If $A$ and $B$ are sets, if $x\in{B}$, and if $x\notin{A}\cap{B}$,
            then $x\notin{A}$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            For if $x\notin{A}\cap{B}$ then either $x\notin{A}$ or $x\notin{B}$
            (Def.~\ref{def:Intersection_of_Two_Sets}). But $x\in{B}$, and
            therefore $x\notin{A}$.

                        {Intersections_of_Two_Sets}
            If we let $A$ and $B$ be the sets defined by:

            \end{subequations}
            \par\vspace{2.5ex}
            we have that the intersection is then:
            \begin{equation}
                A\cap{B}=\{\,1\,\}
            \end{equation}
            Letting $\mathbb{N}_{e}$ and $\mathbb{N}_{o}$ once again denote
            the even and odd non-negative integers, respectively, we have:
            \begin{equation}
                \mathbb{N}_{e}\cap\mathbb{N}_{o}=\emptyset
            \end{equation}
            This is precisely what was meant earlier when it was claimed that
            $\mathbb{N}_{e}$ and $\mathbb{N}_{o}$ are disjoint%
            \index{Disjoint Sets}. If $n,m\in\mathbb{N}$ and if $n<m$, we have:
            \begin{equation}
                \mathbb{Z}_{n}\cap\mathbb{Z}_{m}=\mathbb{Z}_{n}
            \end{equation}
            This is because every element of $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ is an element
            of $\mathbb{Z}_{m}$. This creates a more general theorem that if
            $A\subseteq{B}$, then $A\cap{B}=A$. Intersections thus seem like
            antonyms of unions.
        \end{fexample}
        Similar to how unions can be visualized with Venn diagrams
        (Fig.~\ref{fig:Union_of_Two_Sets}), so can the intersection of
        two sets. We draw two circles that overlap slightly, and consider the
        region contained in both (see Fig.~\ref{fig:Intersection_of_Two_Sets}).
        \begin{figure}[H]

            \label{fig:Intersection_of_Two_Sets}
        \end{figure}
        We can extend this further and define the intersection over any
        collection of sets.
        \begin{theorem}
            \label{thm:Existence_of_Arbitrary_Intersetions}%
            If $\mathcal{O}$ is a set, then there exists a set
            $\mathcal{C}$ such that, for all $x$ it is true that
            $x\in\mathcal{C}$ if and only if for all
            $\mathcal{U}\in\mathcal{O}$ it is true that $x\in\mathcal{U}$.
            That is:
            \begin{equation}
                \mathcal{C}=\bigcap_{\mathcal{U}\in\mathcal{O}}\mathcal{U}
            \end{equation}
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            For by Thm.~\ref{thm:Existence_of_Unions} there is a set
            $\bigcup\mathcal{U}$ such that for all $x$ it is true that
            $x\in\bigcup\mathcal{U}$ if and only if for all
            $\mathcal{U}\in\mathcal{O}$ it is true that $x\in\mathcal{U}$. Let
            $P$ be the proposition \textit{True if for all}
            $\mathcal{U}\in\mathcal{O}$ \textit{it is true that}
            $x\in\mathcal{U}$, \textit{false otherwise}. Then by the
            axiom schema of specification
            (Ax.~\ref{ax:Axiom_Schema_of_Specification}), there exists the set:
            \begin{equation}
                \mathcal{C}
                =\Big\{\,x\in\bigcup_{\mathcal{U}\in\mathcal{O}}\mathcal{U}
                    \;|\;P(x)\,\Big\}
            \end{equation}
            But then $x\in\mathcal{C}$ if and only if $x\in\bigcup\mathcal{U}$
            and $P(x)$ is true. But if $P(x)$ is true, then for all
            $\mathcal{U}\in\mathcal{O}$ it is true that $x\in\mathcal{U}$. But
            then there is a $\mathcal{U}\in\mathcal{O}$ such that
            $x\in\mathcal{U}$, and thus $P(x)$ implies that
            $x\in\bigcup\mathcal{U}$. Therefore $x\in\mathcal{C}$ if and only if
            for all $\mathcal{U}\in\mathcal{O}$ it is true that
            $x\in\mathcal{U}$.
        \end{proof}
        It is common to consider some \textit{universal} set, of which all
        other sets of current consideration are drawn from. Using this the
        definition of arbitrary intersection is defined as the subset of
        this universal set such that every element of this subset is
        contained in every element of the arbitrary collection. One may then
        ask what would happen if the collection is empty. Using this
        definition the intersection would be the entire universal set
        in a vacuous sense. That is, there would be no $x$ in the universe
        that fails the definition of the intersection over an empty
        collection, and thus the intersection is everything. Letting $X$
        denote our universe, we obtain:
        \begin{equation}
            \emptyset=\bigcup_{\mathcal{U}\in\emptyset}\mathcal{U}
                \subseteq\bigcap_{\mathcal{U}\in\emptyset}\mathcal{U}
            =X
        \end{equation}
        It seems like unions should always be bigger. Indeed, for any
        non-empty collection, the intersection over the collection is a
        subset of the union over the collection. Because of this we do
        not adopt this definition of the intersection over a collection,
        but rather require in our construction the use of the union over
        the collection, and then use the axiom schema of specification to
        pick the subset of all elements of the union that belong to every
        element of the collection. Thus:
        \begin{equation}
            \bigcap_{\mathcal{U}\in\emptyset}\mathcal{U}
            \subseteq\bigcup_{\mathcal{U}\in\emptyset}\mathcal{U}
            =\emptyset
        \end{equation}
        And from this we conclude the intersection is empty as well.
        \begin{fdefinition}{Intersection Over a Collection}
                           {Intersection_Over_a_Collection}
            The \gls{intersection over a set} $\mathcal{O}$
            of sets is the set:
            \begin{equation*}
                \bigcap_{E\in\mathcal{O}}E
                =\Big\{\,x\in\bigcup_{E\in\mathcal{O}}E\;\Big|\;x\in{E}
                    \textrm{ for all }E\in\mathcal{O}\,\Big\}
            \end{equation*}
        \end{fdefinition}
        We can extend our Venn diagram for larger collections as well
        (see Fig.~\ref{fig:Intersection_of_Three_Sets}).
        \begin{figure}[H]

        Next on the list of axioms is that of \textit{regularity}.
        \begin{faxiom}{Axiom of Regularity}{Axiom_of_Regularity}
            If $A$ is a non-empty set, then there is an element $B\in{A}$
            such that $A\cap{B}=\emptyset$.\index{Axiom!of Regularity}
            \begin{equation*}
                \forall_{A}(\exists_{x\in{A}})\Rightarrow
                \exists_{y}:\Big((y\in{A})\land
                \big((y\cap{A})=\emptyset\big)\Big)
            \end{equation*}
        \end{faxiom}
        This axiom is often seen as unnecessary by many working mathematicians
        and indeed it's use seems to only lie in set theory and foundations.
        That is, unlike the axioms of choice and union which are widely
        applicable to analysis and topology, regularity seems to only be useful
        to set theoriests. Nevertheless, it is vital to support the claim that
        ZFC is a good system to base mathematics on. We will combine this with
        pairing to prove that for any set $A$ it is true that $A\notin{A}$. That
        is, Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory is free of Russell's
        paradox\index{Russell's Paradox}.
        \begin{theorem}
            \label{thm:Anti_Russells_Paradox}%
            If $A$ is a set, then $A\notin{A}$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            For if $A$ is a set, then $\{A\}$ is a set
            (Thm.~\ref{thm:Existence_of_Set_Containing_Set}). But since
            $A\in\{A\}$, $\{A\}$ is a non-empty set
            (Def.~\ref{def:Non_Empty_Set}). Thus by the axiom of regularity
            (Ax.~\ref{ax:Axiom_of_Regularity}), there is a set $B\in\{A\}$ such
            that $B\cap\{A\}=\emptyset$. But $B\in\{A\}$ if and only if
            $B=A$, and therefore $A\cap\{A\}=\emptyset$. Thus, by the axiom of
            the empty set (Ax.~\ref{ax:Axiom_of_the_Empty_Set}), for all $x$ it
            is true that $x\notin{A}\cap\{A\}$ and therefore
            $A\notin{A}\cap\{A\}$. But $A\in\{A\}$ and therefore
            $A\notin{A}$ (Thm.~\ref{thm:Lemma_for_Anti_Russells_Paradox}).
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
            \label{thm:Containment_NEqual_Underlying_Set}%
            If $A$ and $B$ are sets and if $A\in{B}$, then $A\ne{B}$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            For $A\notin{A}$ (Thm.~\ref{thm:Anti_Russells_Paradox}) and
            $A\in{B}$ and therefore it is not true that for all $x$, $x\in{A}$
            if and only if $x\in{B}$. Therefore, by the Axiom of
            Extensionality (Ax.~\ref{ax:Axiom_of_Extensionality}), $A\ne{B}$.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}
            If $A$ is a set, then $A\ne\{A\}$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            \label{thm:Cor_of_Containment_NEqual_Underlying_Set}%
            For if $A$ is a set, then $A\notin{A}$
            (Thm.~\ref{thm:Anti_Russells_Paradox}). But if $A$ is a set, then
            $\{A\}$ is a set (Thm.~\ref{thm:Existence_of_Set_Containing_Set}).
            But $A\in\{A\}$, and thus $A\ne\{A\}$
            (Thm.~\ref{thm:Containment_NEqual_Underlying_Set}).
        \end{proof}
        This quick theorem will eventually prove the well known result that
        $0\ne{1}$. It also shows that there is no set of all
        sets\index{Set!of All Sets}.
    \subsection{The Axiom of the Power Set}
        Continuing in our goal of constructing order, we move on to the
        Cartesian product of two sets $A$ and $B$. This is the collection of
        all ordered pairs $(a,b)$ such that $a\in{A}$ and $b\in{B}$. To prove
        such a set exists requires the \textit{axiom of the power set}.
        \begin{faxiom}{Axiom of the Power Set}{Axiom_of_the_Power_Set}
            If $X$ is a set, then there exists a set $\mathscr{P}$ such that,
            for all $A\subseteq{X}$, it is true that $A\in\mathscr{P}$.
            \index{Axiom!of the Power Set}
            \begin{equation*}
                \forall_{X}\exists_{\mathscr{P}}:
                \forall_{A}(A\subseteq{X})\Rightarrow{A}\in\mathscr{P}
            \end{equation*}
        \end{faxiom}
        Again, much like the axiom of union and the axiom of pairing, this
        set may be bigger than we would like. We wish to find a set, called
        the \textit{power set}, the contains all of the subsets of a given
        set $A$ and nothing else. Combining the axiom of the power set
        with the axiom schema of specification gives us such existence.
        \begin{ltheorem}{Existence of the Power Set}
                        {Existence_of_the_Power_Set}
            If $A$ is a set, then there exists a set $\mathcal{P}(A)$
            such that, for all $x$ it is true that $x\in\mathcal{P}(A)$ if and
            only if $x\subseteq{A}$.
        \end{ltheorem}
        \begin{proof}
            For by the axiom of the power set
            (Ax.~\ref{ax:Axiom_of_the_Power_Set}), there is a set
            $\mathscr{P}(A)$ such that for all $x\subseteq{A}$ it is true
            that $x\in\mathscr{P}(A)$. Let $P$ be the proposition
            \textit{true if} $x\subseteq{A}$, \textit{false otherwise}. By the
            axiom schema of specification
            (Ax.~\ref{ax:Axiom_Schema_of_Specification}), there is a set
            $\mathcal{P}(A)$ such that:
            \begin{equation}
                \mathcal{P}(A)=\{\,x\in\mathscr{P}(A)\;|\;P(x)\,\}
            \end{equation}
            But if $P(x)$ is true, then $x$ is a subset of $A$, and therefore
            $x\in\mathscr{P}(A)$. Thus $x\in\mathcal{P}(A)$ if and only if
            $x\subseteq{A}$.
        \end{proof}
        With this we now define the \textit{power set} of a given set.
        \begin{fdefinition}{Power Set}{Power_Set}
            The \gls{power set} of a \gls{set} $X$ is the set $\mathcal{P}(X)$
            defined by:\index{Power Set}
            \begin{equation*}
                \mathcal{P}(X)=\{\,A\;|\;A\subseteq{X}\,\}
            \end{equation*}
            That is, the set of all subsets of $X$.
            \begin{equation*}
                \forall_{A}\forall_{B}\Big(B\in\mathcal{P}(A)\Longleftarrow
                    B\subseteq{A}\Big)
            \end{equation*}
        \end{fdefinition}
        Thm.~\ref{thm:Existence_of_the_Power_Set} justifies such a definition.
        The power set of a set is a crucial construction for when one discusses
        the \textit{cardinality} of sets, denoted $\textrm{Card}(A)$. This
        describes the \textit{size} of a set in a very precise manner. A theorem
        that will eventually be proved known as
        \textit{Cantor's Theorem}\index{Cantor's Power Set Theorem} shows that
        the power set of a set is always strictly \textit{larger} than the
        original set. That is:
        \begin{equation}
            \textrm{Card}(A)<\textrm{Card}\big(\mathcal{P}(A)\big)
        \end{equation}
        This will be made precise soon enough. The axiom of the power set allows
        us to build \textit{larger} sets from a given set. That is, given a set
        $A$ it is true that $A\ne\mathcal{P}(A)$ (otherwise we would violate the
        axiom of regularity). But since $A\in\mathcal{P}(A)$ we see that the
        power set is in a sense \textit{larger}.
        \begin{example}
            If $A=\{1,2\}$, then the power set is:
            \begin{equation}
                \mathcal{P}(A)=\big\{\,\emptyset,\,\{1\},\,\{2\},\,
                    \{1,2\}\,\big\}
            \end{equation}
            We must consider the empty set since $\emptyset\subseteq{A}$.
            Now suppose $A=\{1,2,3\}$:
            \begin{equation}
                \mathcal{P}(A)=\big\{\,\emptyset,\,\{1\},\,\{2\},\,\{3\},\,
                    \{1,2\},\,\{1,3\},\,\{2,3\},\,\{1,2,3\}\,\big\}
            \end{equation}
            We see that a set with 2 elements has a power set with 4 elements
            and a set with 3 elements has a power set with 8. This pattern
            continues for finite sets and if $A$ has $n$ elements, then
            $\mathcal{P}(A)$ has $2^{n}$ elements.
        \end{example}
        \begin{example}
            When we consider the case of an \textit{infinite} set $A$ we have
            that $\mathcal{P}(A)$ is a strictly larger set and this creates a
            paradoxical heirarchy of infinities. The smallest heirarchy is
            that of the \textit{countable} infinite sets, like $\mathbb{N}$.
            Everything larger is called \textit{uncountable}. It will be
            shown that the following is true:
            \begin{equation}
                \Card\big(\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})\big)=
                \Card(\mathbb{R})
            \end{equation}
            where again $\mathbb{N}$ denotes the non-negative integers and
            $\mathbb{R}$ denotes the set of all \textit{real} numbers. We
            can loosely show this by using the binary representation of real
            numbers. A real number may be thought of as an infinite decimal.
            For example, $\pi=3.1415926\dots$ and $1=1.000\dots$ We can
            also represent real numbers as a sequence of zeroes and ones and
            this is the \textit{binary} representation. For
            $A\subseteq\mathbb{N}$ and let $r_{A}=0.n_{1}n_{2}\hdots$ where:
            \begin{equation}
                n_{i}=
                \begin{cases}
                    0,&i\notin{A}\\
                    1,&i\in{A}
                \end{cases}
            \end{equation}
            Thus for each $A\in\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$ there is a real
            number $r_{A}$ such that $0\leq{r}_{A}\leq{1}$ that is
            associated with it, and moreover to every real number between
            zero and one there is a subset of $\mathbb{N}$ associated with
            it. The tricky numbers to see are zero and one, but note that
            $r_{\emptyset}$ is associated to 0 and $r_{\mathbb{N}}$ gets
            paired with 1. To show that $\mathbb{R}$ and
            $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$ are the same size requires us to
            refine this association so that every element of
            $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$ uniquely corresponds to an element of
            $\mathbb{R}$, and vice-versa.
        \end{example}
    \subsection{Cartesian Products and Functions}
        In the previous section we introduced ordered pairs and the notion of
        the power set. We can use both of these concepts to define and prove
        the existence of \textit{Cartesian products}. Intuitively we want to
        define $A\times{B}$ to be the set of all ordered pairs $(a,b)$ where
        $a\in{A}$ and $b\in{B}$:
        \begin{equation}
            A\times{B}=\big\{\,(a,\,b)\;|\;a\in{A}\textrm{ and }b\in{B}\,\big\}
        \end{equation}
        But recalling Def.~\ref{def:Ordered_Pairs}, ordered pairs are sets
        of the form $\{\{a\},\{a,b\}\}$. Thus elements of $A\times{B}$ are
        contained in the power set of the power set of $A\cup{B}$:
        \begin{equation}
            A\times{B}\subseteq\mathcal{P}\big(\mathcal{P}(A\cup{B})\big)
        \end{equation}
        We can combine the axiom of the power set with the axiom schema of
        specification to obtain the existence of the Cartesian product of
        two sets.
        \begin{theorem}
            \label{thm:Ordered_Pair_Subset_of_Power_Set}%
            If $A$ and $B$ are sets, if $a\in{A}$ and $b\in{B}$, then
            $(a,b)\subseteq\mathcal{P}(A\cup{B})$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            For if $a\in{A}$ and $b\in{B}$, then
            $(a,b)=\{\,\{\,a\,\},\,\{\,a,\,b\,\}\,\}$
            (Def.~\ref{def:Ordered_Pairs}). But if $a\in{A}$, then $a\in{A}$
            or $a\in{B}$, and thus $a\in{A}\cup{B}$
            (Def.~\ref{def:Union_of_Two_Sets}). But then
            $\{\,a\,\}\subseteq{A}\cup{B}$ (Def.~\ref{def:Subsets}). But if
            $b\in{B}$, then $b\in{A}$ or $b\in{B}$, and thus $b\in{A}\cup{B}$
            (Def.~\ref{def:Union_of_Two_Sets}). But then
            $\{\,a,\,b\,\}\subseteq{A}\cup{B}$ (Def.~\ref{def:Subsets}).
            But then $\{\,a\,\}\subseteq{A}\cup{B}$ and
            $\{\,a,\,b\,\}\subseteq{A}\cup{B}$, and thus
            $(a,b)\subseteq\mathcal{P}(A\cup{B})$ (Def.~\ref{def:Power_Set}).
        \end{proof}
        \begin{ltheorem}{Existence of the Cartesian Product}
                        {Existence_of_the_Cartesian_Product}
            If $A$ and $B$ are sets, then there exists a set $A\times{B}$
            such that, for all $z$, $z\in{A}\times{B}$ if and only if there
            is an $a\in{A}$ and $b\in{B}$ such that $z=(a,b)$.
        \end{ltheorem}
        \begin{proof}
            For if $A$ and $B$ are sets, then by the axiom of union
            (Ax.~\ref{ax:Axiom_of_Union}), $A\cup{B}$ is a set. But if
            $A\cup{B}$ is a set, by the axiom of the power set
            (Ax.~\ref{ax:Axiom_of_the_Power_Set}), $\mathcal{P}(A\cup{B})$ is
            a set, where $\mathcal{P}(X)$ denotes the power set of $X$. But if
            $\mathcal{P}(A\cup{B})$ is a set, then
            $\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(A\cup{B}))$ is a set
            (Ax.~\ref{ax:Axiom_of_the_Power_Set}). But then
            $z\in\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(A\cup{B}))$ if and only if
            $z\subseteq\mathcal{P}(A\cup{B})$ (Def.~\ref{def:Power_Set}).
            But if $a\in{A}$ and $b\in{B}$, then
            $(a,b)\subseteq\mathcal{P}(A\cup{B})$
            (Thm.~\ref{thm:Ordered_Pair_Subset_of_Power_Set}), and therefore
            $(a,b)\in\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(A\cup{B}))$
            (Def.~\ref{def:Power_Set}). Let $P$ be the proposition
            \textit{True if there exists} $a\in{A}$ \textit{and}
            $b\in{B}$ \textit{such that} $z=(a,b)$, \textit{false otherwise}.
            Then by the axiom schema of specification
            (Ax.~\ref{ax:Axiom_Schema_of_Specification}), there exists a
            set $A\times{B}$ such that:
            \begin{equation}
                A\times{B}=
                \{\,z\in\mathcal{P}\big(\mathcal{P}(A\cup{B})\big)\;|\;
                    P(z)\,\}
            \end{equation}
            But it was proved that $P(z)$ implies that
            $z\in\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(A\cup{B}))$. Thus $z\in{A}\times{B}$
            if and only if there exists $a\in{A}$ and $b\in{B}$
            such that $z=(a,b)$.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{fdefinition}{Cartesian Product of Two Sets}
                           {Cartesian_Product_of_Two_Sets}
            The \gls{Cartesian product} of two \glspl{set} $A$ and $B$ is the
            set
            \begin{equation*}
                A\times{B}
                =\{\,(a,\,b)\;|\;a\in{A}\textrm{ and }b\in{B}\,\}
            \end{equation*}
        \end{fdefinition}
        Note that since, in general, $(a,b)\ne(b,a)$, it is generally true that
        $A\times{B}\ne{B}\times{A}$. Indeed, equality occurs if and only if
        $A=B$ (or if either set is empty).
        \begin{fexample}{Basic Cartesian Products}{Basic_Cartesian_Products}
            Let $A$ and $B$ be sets defined as follows:

            \end{subequations}
            \par\vspace{2.5ex}
            Let's compute $A\times{B}$ and $B\times{A}$. From the definition
            (Def.~\ref{def:Cartesian_Product_of_Two_Sets}) we have:
            \begin{equation}
                A\times{B}=\{\,(a,b)\;|\;a\in{A}\textrm{ and }b\in{B}\,\}
            \end{equation}
            Using this, we can compute:
            \begin{equation}
                A\times{B}=\big\{\,(1,a),\,(2,a),\,(3,a),\,
                                   (1,b),\,(2,b),\,(3,b)\,\big\}
            \end{equation}
            Computing $B\times{A}$, we have:
            \begin{equation}
                B\times{A}=\big\{\,(a,\,1),\,(a,\,2),\,(a,\,3),\,
                                   (b,\,1),\,(b,\,2),\,(b,\,3)\,\big\}
            \end{equation}
            Now if we suppose that $a$ is not equal to 1, then we see that
            $(a,1)$ is a different element than $(1,a)$, and thus $A\times{B}$
            is not equal to $B\times{A}$. Next, compute $A\times{A}$:
            \begin{equation}
                \begin{split}
                    A\times{A}=\Big\{\,(1,1),\,(1,2),\,&(1,3),
                                       (2,1),\,(2,2),\,\\&(2,3),
                                       (3,1),\,(3,2),\,(3,3)\,\Big\}
                \end{split}
            \end{equation}
            And finally $B\times{B}$:
            \begin{equation}
                B\times{B}=\big\{\,(a,\,a),\,(a,\,b),
                                 \,(b,\,a),\,(b,\,b)\,\big\}
            \end{equation}
            Equality of $A\times{B}$ and $B\times{A}$ is achieved if and only
            if $A=B$, or if either set is the empty set.
        \end{fexample}
        Note that in Ex.~\ref{ex:Basic_Cartesian_Products}, the \textit{size}
        of the Cartesian product of two sets was simply the product of the
        number of elements of the constituent sets. That is, we see that $A$
        has three elements and $B$ has two elements, but also that
        $A\times{B}$ has six elements. Moreover, $A\times{A}$ has nine
        elements and $B\times{B}$ has four. This pattern holds for the
        Cartesian products of any two \textit{finite} sets.
        \par\hfill\par
        It is common to consider the Cartesian product of a set with itself.
        That is, given a set $A$, we are often interested in $A\times{A}$. We
        denote this by writing $A^{2}$. One such example is when we consider
        the set of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$. The Cartesian product
        $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is called the \textit{Euclidean Plane},
        or the \textit{Cartesian Plane}, after Euclid of Alexandria%
        \index{Euclide of Alexandria} and Ren\'{e} Descartes%
        \index{Descartes, Ren\'{e}}. This is because $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is used to
        model both planar geometry and analytical geometry, of which Euclid and
        Descartes were pioneers of, respectively. The term Cartesian products
        is in honor of Ren\'{e} Descartes, as well.
        Let $\mathbb{R}$ denote the set of real numbers, and let
        $A=\mathbb{R}$ and $B=\mathbb{R}$. Then we have:
        \begin{equation}
            A\times{B}=\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}\equiv\mathbb{R}^{2}
        \end{equation}
        Where the symbol $\equiv$ again means that $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is
        defined by this expression. Using the definition of Cartesian
        products (Def.~\ref{def:Cartesian_Product_of_Two_Sets}), we obtain:
        \begin{equation}
            \mathbb{R}^{2}=\{\;(x,y)\,:\,x\in\mathbb{R}
                               \textrm{ and }y\in\mathbb{R}\;\}
        \end{equation}
        That is, $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is the set of all ordered pairs of real
        numbers. The first term is called the $x$ coordinate, and similarly the
        second term is called the $y$ coordinate. We envision this as a
        \textit{plane} of points, each one corresponding to an ordered pair
        $(x,y)$. This is depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:Cartesian_Plane}.
        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \input{tikz/Cartesian_Product_001.tex}
            \caption{The Cartesian Plane $\mathbb{R}^{2}$}
            \label{fig:Cartesian_Plane}
        \end{figure}
        Consider further the set $\mathbb{N}^{2}$. That is, letting
        $\mathbb{N}$ denote the set of natural numbers
        (Eqn.~\ref{eqn:Natural_Numbers_Ellipses}), letting $A=\mathbb{N}$ and
        $B=\mathbb{N}$ we have:
        \begin{equation}
            A\times{B}=\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}\equiv\mathbb{N}^{2}
        \end{equation}
        Again using the definition of Cartesian products
        (Def.~\ref{def:Cartesian_Product_of_Two_Sets}), we have:
        \begin{equation}
            \mathbb{N}^{2}=
            \{\,(n,\,m)\;|\;n\in\mathbb{N}\textrm{ and }m\in\mathbb{N}\,\}
        \end{equation}
        We can visualize this as a subset of $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ by drawing a
        lattice of points in the Cartesian plane
        (Fig.~\ref{fig:Lattice_Cart_Prod_of_N_with_N}).
        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \input{tikz/Cartesian_Product_002.tex}
            \caption{The Lattice $\mathbb{N}^{2}$}
            \label{fig:Lattice_Cart_Prod_of_N_with_N}
        \end{figure}
        This can then be consider a subset of the Euclidean plane
        $\mathbb{R}^{2}$. That is, at every ordered pair of integers $(m,n)$,
        we place a point in the Euclidean plane whose $x$ coordinate is $m$ and
        whose $y$ coordinate is $n$. We can also be more abstract and general in
        our examples. Consider the following sets:

        We can visually represent the Cartesian product $A\times{B}$ by
        drawing $A$ in green and $B$ in red, as shown in
        Fig.~\ref{fig:Cartesian_Product_Example}. The Cartesian Product
        $A\times{B}$ is the set formed by connecting all of the points
        from $A$ and $B$ in the plane. This is shown in blue.
        \begin{figure}[H]

                 in \textcolor{green}{Green},
                 $B$ is in \textcolor{red}{red}, and
                 $A\times{B}$ is in \textcolor{blue}{blue}.}
            \label{fig:Cartesian_Product_Example}
        \end{figure}
        Cartesian products are not \textit{associative}. That is, given three
        sets $A$, $B$, and $C$, there is no clear way to take the Cartesian
        product of these since:
        \begin{equation}
            A\times(B\times{C})\ne(A\times{B})\times{C}
        \end{equation}
        To see this, note that the elements of $A\times(B\times{C})$ are
        ordered pairs of the form $\big(a,\,(b,\,c)\big)$, whereas elements of
        $(A\times{B})\times{C}$ are of the form $\big((a,\,b),\,c\big)$. When
        we write $A\times{B}\times{C}$ we really want ordered \textit{triples}
        of the form $(a,\,b,\,c)$.
        Much the way ordered pairs have been
        defined, we can modify Kuratowski's approach and define ordered
        triples and ordered $n$ tuples. Rather than doing this we will use the
        language of functions to define higher order Cartesian products.
        \begin{fdefinition}{Functions}{Function}
            A \gls{function} from a \gls{set} $A$ to a set $B$ is a \gls{subset}
            $f\subseteq{A}\times{B}$, denoted $f:A\rightarrow{B}$, such that
            for all $x\in{A}$ there is a unique $y\in{B}$ such that
            $(x,y)\in{f}$. $A$ is called the domain of $f$
            and $B$ is called the codomain.
        \end{fdefinition}
        We're used to hearing that a function is a rule that assigns to an
        input value $x$ some output value $f(x)$. It may seem hard to justify,
        then, why we've defined a function as a subset of the Cartesian
        product. But note the requirement that, for each $x\in{A}$, there is a
        \textit{unique} $y\in{B}$ such that $(x,y)\in{f}$. We call this unique
        element the \textit{image} of $x$ under the function $f$ and write
        $y=f(x)$. The condition that there is a unique such value $y$ to each
        $x$ is called the \textit{vertical line test} when graphing functions
        of the form $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$
        (Fig.~\ref{fig:Function_R_to_R_Subset_Cart_Prod}). Simply, given such
        a function, if one draws a vertical line in the plane, then it must
        intersect the graph of $f$ once and only once. This provides a
        quick means of discerning functions from non-functions.
        \begin{lexample}{The Square Function}{Square_Function}
            If we can come up with some rule that assigns to every element
            $a\in{A}$ a unique element of $B$, then we can use this rule to
            define a function $f:A\rightarrow{B}$. Such a rule often comes
            in the form of a \textit{formula}. We write the unique element that
            $a$ corresponds to as $f(b)$. For example, let $A=\mathbb{R}$ and
            let $B=\mathbb{R}$. We can define a function by the squaring
            formula:
            \begin{equation}
                f(x)=x\cdot{x}=x^{2}
            \end{equation}
            Once we know that $x^{2}$ gives a unique number
            (which will require some notion of arithmetic), we can define
            the function $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ by:
            \begin{equation}
                f=\{\,(x,\,x^{2})\in\mathbb{R}^{2}\;|\;x\in\mathbb{R}\,\}
            \end{equation}
            Usually we'll define functions by their formula's, rather than
            expressing them explicitly as subsets of the Cartesian product.
        \end{lexample}
        In the field of mathematical analysis we are often concerned with
        functions involving real numbers. For the sake of intuition, let
        us consider functions of the form $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$.
        Any curve that we draw left-to-right, without picking up the pencil,
        will be a valid function.
        (See Fig.~\ref{fig:Function_R_to_R_Subset_Cart_Prod}).

        Let $g\subseteq\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}$ be defined as follows:
        \begin{equation}
            g=\big\{\,(x,\,y)\in\mathbb{R}^{2}\;|\;y^{2}=x\,\big\}
        \end{equation}
        It is tempting to label $g$ by writing $g(x)=\sqrt{x}$, but $g$ is
        not a function for it fails two of the requirements of a function.
        Firstly, for any $x>0$, there are two values $y_{1}$ and $y_{2}$
        whose square is equal to $x$. Indeed, if $y_{1}$ is one such value,
        then setting $y_{2}=\minus{y}_{1}$ will result in a second
        distinct value. Thus $g$ does not have the uniqueness property
        required for functions. Moreover, if $x<0$, then there is no such
        value $y\in\mathbb{R}$ such that $(x,y)\in{g}$, and thus $g$ also
        lacks the existence property. In terms of the vertical line test,
        there are points $x$ such that the vertical line through
        $(x,\,0)$ intersects $g$ twice, and there are points such that the
        vertical line does not intersect at all. The graph of $g$ is shown
        in Fig.~\ref{fig:SQRT_Not_a_Function}.

        We need not only consider functions of the form
        $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$, nor functions
        $f:\mathcal{U}\rightarrow\mathcal{V}$, where $\mathcal{U}$ and
        $\mathcal{V}$ are subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, and we can allow for
        arbitrary abstract functions. Let $A$ and $B$ be defined as follows:
        \par
        \begin{subequations}
            \begin{minipage}[b]{0.49\textwidth}

        Similar to the vertical line test, we can devise a visual to
        discerning functions from non-functions for abstract sets.
        We represent the elements of $A$ and $B$ as points in some blob
        in the plane, and then draw arrows between the points
        $x\in{A}$ and $y\in{b}$ indicating that $(x,\,y)\in{f}$.
        This allows us to determine if a given $f\subseteq{A}\times{B}$ is a
        functions ore not. Every point in $A$ must be mapped to a unique point
        in $B$. That is, every point in $A$ must have one and only one arrow
        connecting it to some point in $B$. Examples of valid functions
        are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Abstract_Functions}, and non-functions
        are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Abstract_Non_Functions}.

        It is possible to count the total number of functions from $A$ to $B$.
        Since every element of $A$ needs to be mapped to some element of $B$,
        and since there are 4 elements in $A$ and 3 elements in $B$, the total
        number of functions $f:A\rightarrow{B}$ is $4^{3}=64$. On the other
        hand, the total number of subsets of $A\times{B}$ is $2^{12}=4096$
        (we will justify this when we discuss the \textit{cardinality} of
        sets). Thus, if we were to randomly pick a subset of $A\times{B}$, the
        odds are that it is almost certainly \textit{not} a function
        (1.5625\%). Thus, functions are very special subsets.
        There is a frequent need to discuss the \textit{set of all functions}
        from a given set $A$ into another set $B$. To ensure we don't create
        a function version of Russell's paradox, we prove such a set exists.
        \begin{theorem}
            If $A$ and $B$ are sets, then there exists a set $\mathcal{F}$ such
            that, for all $f$ it is true that $f\in\mathcal{F}$ if and only if
            $f$ is a function from $A$ to $B$, $f:A\rightarrow{B}$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            For if $A$ and $B$ are sets, then by
            Thm.~\ref{thm:Existence_of_the_Cartesian_Product} the set
            $A\times{B}$ exists. But by the axiom of the power set
            (Ax.~\ref{ax:Axiom_of_the_Power_Set}) the power set of $A\times{B}$,
            $\mathcal{P}(A\times{B})$, exists. Let $P$ be the proposition
            \textit{True if} $f$ \textit{is a function from} $A$ \textit{to}
            $B$, \textit{false otherwise}. Then by axiom schema of specification
            (Ax.~\ref{ax:Axiom_Schema_of_Specification}), there is a set
            $\mathcal{F}$ such that:
            \begin{equation}
                \mathcal{F}=\big\{\,f\in\mathcal{P}(A\times{B})\;|
                    \;P(f)\,\big\}
            \end{equation}
            But then for all $f$, $f\in\mathcal{F}$ if and only if
            $f\in\mathcal{F}$ and $P(f)$ is true. But if $P(f)$ is true then
            $f$ is a function from $A$ to $B$, and thus by the definition of a
            function (Def.~\ref{def:Function}) $f\subseteq{A}\times{B}$. But
            then by the definition of the power set (Def.~\ref{def:Power_Set})
            we have that $f\in\mathcal{P}(A\times{B})$. Thus $P(f)$ implies
            $f\in\mathcal{F}$. Therefore $f\in\mathcal{F}$ if and only if
            $P(f)$. That is, $f\in\mathcal{F}$ if and only if $f$ is a function
            from $A$ to $B$.
        \end{proof}
        There is non-standard notation when discussing the set of all functions
        from a given set $A$ to a set $B$:
        \begin{fnotation}{Set of All Functions}{Set_of_All_Functions}
            If $A$ and $B$ are sets, the set of all functions from $A$ to $B$,
            $f:A\rightarrow{B}$, is denoted as either $\mathcal{F}(A,B)$ or
            $B^{A}$.
        \end{fnotation}
        The notation $B^{A}$ is common in many areas such as topology and
        algebra, especially when $A=B$. The \textit{topological space} $I^{I}$,
        which is the set of all functions from the \textit{closed unit inverval}
        to itself, is often used to construct examples and counterexamples.
        In analysis the notation $\mathcal{F}(A,B)$ seems to be more common,
        in particular $\mathcal{C}(A,B)$ is often used to denote the set of all
        \textit{continuous} functions from $A$ to $B$, provided the word
        continuous has meaning. Since the notation is not universal nor standard
        across the various disciplines, an attempt will be made to specify what
        $B^{A}$ or $\mathcal{F}(A,B)$ means before using it in a theorem or
        counterexample.
        \begin{fdefinition}{Image of a Point}{Image_of_Point}
            The image of an element $x$ in a set $A$ under a function
            $f:A\rightarrow{B}$ is the unique value $y\in{B}$ such that
            $(x,y)\in{f}$. We write $y=f(x)$.
        \end{fdefinition}
        This allows us to define functions by simply specifying what the
        image of each $x\in{A}$ is. Restating our previous claim, if we can
        define some formula such that for each $x\in{A}$ there is a unique
        $f(x)\in{B}$ such that the formula takes $x$ to $f(x)$, then we can
        define $f$ as the set of all such ordered pairs $(x,f(x))$, and this
        will be a function.
        \begin{fnotation}{Image Notation}{Image_Notation}
            If $A$ and $B$ are sets, if $f:A\rightarrow{B}$ is a function,
            if $x\in{A}$ and if $y=f(x)\in{B}$, then we denote this by
            writing $x\overset{f}{\longmapsto}{y}$ or just $x\mapsto{y}$.
        \end{fnotation}
        Throughout we will almost exclusively use the notation $y=f(x)$ rather
        than $x\mapsto{y}$. The reasons are purely aesthetic and both notations
        are common in mathematics. In a similar manner, we can define the image
        of an entire subset.
        \begin{theorem}
            If $A$ and $B$ are sets, if $f:A\rightarrow{B}$ is a function,
            and if $\mathcal{U}\subseteq{A}$, then there is a set
            $\mathcal{V}\subseteq{B}$ such that, for all $y$ it is true that
            $y\in\mathcal{V}$ if and only if $y\in{B}$ and such that there is
            an $x\in\mathcal{U}$ such that $y=f(x)$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            For let $P$ be the proposition \textit{True if there exists}
            $x\in\mathcal{U}$ \textit{such that} $y=f(x)$,
            \textit{false otherwise}. By the axiom schema of specification
            (Ax.~\ref{ax:Axiom_Schema_of_Specification}) there is a set
            $\mathcal{V}$ such that, for all $y$ it is true that
            $y\in\mathcal{V}$ if and only if $y\in{B}$ and $P(y)$ is true. That
            is, $y\in\mathcal{V}$ if and only if $y\in{B}$ and if there is an
            $x\in\mathcal{U}$ such that $y=f(x)$.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{fdefinition}{Image of a Subset}{Image_of_Subset}
            The image of a subset $\mathcal{U}$ of a set $A$ under a function
            $f:A\rightarrow{B}$ is the set:
            \begin{equation*}
                f\big(\mathcal{U}\big)=
                    \{\,y\in{B}\;|\;\textrm{There exists }x\in\mathcal{U}
                                    \textrm{ such that }y=f(x)\,\}
            \end{equation*}
            That is, the set of all points in $B$ that are the
            image of points in $\mathcal{U}$.
        \end{fdefinition}
        This definition of the image of a subset was given in such a manner
        so that it only relies on the axiom schema of specification to
        justify it's existence. We could also use the notation:
        \begin{equation}
            f\big(\mathcal{U})=\{\,f(x)\in{B}\;|\;x\in\mathcal{U}\,\}
        \end{equation}
        Writing the definition of the image of a subset in such a way is
        justified by the \textit{axiom schema of replacement}, but we've not yet
        included this axiom in our system. This axiom deals with
        \textit{class functions} and will be dealt with later.
        \begin{example}
            If $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is the function $f(x)=x^{2}$,
            then $f(\mathbb{R})=[0,\infty)$, where $[0,\infty)$ is defined by:
            \begin{equation}
                [0,\infty)=\{\,x\in\mathbb{R}\;|\;x\geq{0}\}
            \end{equation}
            To see this, not that every positive real number $y$ gets mapped to
            by at least one real number (notably, the positive square root
            $\sqrt{y}$). Zero is mapped to as well since $0^{2}=0$. However,
            none of the negative numbers are the image of any element of
            $\mathbb{R}$ since the square of a real number is always
            non-negative.
        \end{example}
        We can visualize functions and images by using blobs in the plane. Given
        some sub-blob of a set $A$, the image of this will be another sub-blob
        of $B$. Note that if $f:A\rightarrow{B}$ is a function, it does
        \textbf{not} need to be true that $f(A)=B$. These are special functions
        that are called \textit{surjective}\index{Function!Surjective} and are
        discussed in Chapt.~\ref{chapt:Function_Theory}. Such a drawing of the
        general case is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Image_of_Point_and_Subset}.
        \begin{figure}[H]

            \label{fig:Image_of_Point_and_Subset}
        \end{figure}
        If we consider a function $f:A\rightarrow{B}$ and the image of the
        entire set $A$ we obtain the \textit{range} of $f$. That is, the range
        is the set $f(A)\subseteq{B}$. In a similar manner to the forward image
        of a function, we can define the pre-image. First, we prove such things
        exist.
        \begin{theorem}
            \label{thm:Existence_of_Pre_Image}%
            If $A$ and $B$ are sets, if $f:A\rightarrow{B}$ is a function from
            $A$ to $B$, and if $\mathcal{V}\subseteq{B}$, then there is a set
            $\mathcal{U}\subseteq{A}$ such that for all $x$ it is true that
            $x\in\mathcal{U}$ if and only if $x\in{A}$ and $f(x)\in\mathcal{V}$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            For let $P$ be the proposition \textit{True if} $x\in{A}$
            \textit{and} $f(x)\in\mathcal{V}$, \textit{false otherwise}. Then
            by the axiom schema of specification
            (Ax.~\ref{ax:Axiom_Schema_of_Specification}) there is a set
            $\mathcal{U}$ such that:
            \begin{equation*}
                \mathcal{U}=\big\{\,x\in{A}\;|\;P(x)\,\big\}
            \end{equation*}
            But $P(x)$ implies $x\in{A}$ and thus $x\in\mathcal{U}$ if and only
            if $x\in{A}$ and $f(x)\in\mathcal{V}$.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{fdefinition}{Pre-Image of a Subset}{Pre_Image_of_Subset}
            The \gls{pre-image} of a \gls{subset} $\mathcal{V}\subseteq{B}$
            under a \gls{function} $f:A\rightarrow{B}$ is the set:
            \begin{equation}
                f^{\minus{1}}(\mathcal{V})
                =\big\{\,x\in{X}\;|\;f(x)\in\mathcal{V}\,\big\}
            \end{equation}
        \end{fdefinition}
        The pre-image of a set behaves a lot differently than the image, and
        this will be explored in detail when functions are discussed. The cause
        of the discrepancy is the requirement that elements of $A$ map uniquely
        to elements of $B$, but a single element in $B$ can be the image of
        many different points in $A$. This gives rise to the notion of a
        \textit{fiber} of a point in $B$.
        \begin{theorem}
            If $A$ and $B$ are sets, if $f:A\rightarrow{B}$ is a function, and
            if $b\in{A}$, then there is a set $\mathcal{U}\subseteq{A}$ such
            for all $x\in{A}$ it is true that $x\in\mathcal{U}$ if and only if
            $f(x)=b$.
        \end{theorem}
        \begin{proof}
            For by Thm.~\ref{thm:Existence_of_Set_Containing_Set}, $\{b\}$ is
            a set and $\{b\}\subseteq{B}$ (Def.~\ref{def:Subsets}). But if
            $\{b\}$ is a subset of $B$, then there is a set
            $\mathcal{U}\subseteq{A}$ such that for all $x\in{A}$ it is true
            that $x\in\mathcal{U}$ if and only if $f(x)\in\{b\}$
            (Thm.~\ref{thm:Existence_of_Pre_Image}). But $f(x)\in\{b\}$ if and
            only if $f(x)=b$ (Thm.~\ref{thm:Existence_of_Set_Containing_Set}).
            Thus, for all $x\in{A}$, $x\in\mathcal{U}$ if and only if $f(x)=b$.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{fdefinition}{Fiber of an Element}{Fiber_of_Element}
            The fiber of an element $b$ in a set $B$ under a function
            $f:A\rightarrow{B}$ from a set $A$ to a set $B$ is the pre-image
            of the set $\{b\}$. That is:
            \begin{equation*}
                f^{\minus{1}}(\{b\})
                =\big\{\,a\in{A}\:|\;f(a)=b\,\big\}
            \end{equation*}
        \end{fdefinition}
        Since the set $b\in{B}$ we have that $\{b\}\subseteq{B}$
        (Def.~\ref{def:Subsets}) and thus there is no need to prove again that
        the fiber of an element $b\in{B}$ is a valid set, since
        Thm.~\ref{thm:Existence_of_Pre_Image} applies.
    \subsection{The Axiom of Choice and Diaconescu's Theorem}
        The next two axioms to be introduced are the most controversial of those
        listed in ZFC: The \textit{axiom of infinity} and the
        \textit{axiom of choice}. While the axiom of infinity only has a
        small number of critics, the axiom of choice is far more contentious.
        Choice is equivalent to many other statements that come across in
        almost all forms of mathematics (analysis, algebra, topology, etc.).
        Many of which are theorems we would \textit{want} to be true, and so
        accepting the axiom of choice allows us to prove them. In particular,
        the axioms presented thus far can be combined with the axiom of choice
        to prove the \textit{Law of the Excluded Middle}, a result known as
        Diaconescu's theorem, and this is our current goal.
        \begin{faxiom}{Axiom of Choice}{Axiom_of_Choice}
            If $\mathcal{O}$ is a non-empty set such that for all
            $\mathcal{U}\in\mathcal{O}$ it is true that $\mathcal{U}$ is
            non-empty, and if $\mathcal{F}$ is the union over $\mathcal{O}$:
            \index{Axiom!of Choice}
            \begin{equation*}
                \mathcal{F}=\bigcup_{\mathcal{U}\in\mathcal{O}}\mathcal{U}
            \end{equation*}
            then there is a function $f:\mathcal{O}\rightarrow\mathcal{F}$ such
            that, for all $x\in\mathcal{O}$, $f(x)\in{x}$
        \end{faxiom}
        Such a function is called a choice function. The axiom can be made
        obviously true if we word it one way, and obviously false if we word it
        another. To convince one that is it true will require talking about
        products. The Cartesian product has been defined using ordered pairs
        as defined by Kuratowski and allows us to order two elements. Given two
        sets $A$ and $B$ we can define an equivalent notion of the Cartesian
        product using the set of all functions from $\mathbb{Z}_{2}=\{0,1\}$
        into $A\cup{B}$ with a particular property:
        \begin{equation}
            A\times{B}=
            \big\{\,f:\mathbb{Z}_{2}\rightarrow{A}\cup{B}\;|\;
                f(0)\in{A}\textrm{ and }f(1)\in{B}\,\big\}
        \end{equation}
        To see why this is equivalent to the actual Cartesian product, note that
        the Cartesian product $A\times{B}$ is the set of all ordered pairs whose
        first entry lies in $A$ and whose second entry lies in $B$. Given
        $a\in{A}$ and $b\in{B}$, let $f:\mathbb{Z}_{2}\rightarrow{A}\cup{B}$ be
        the function such that $f(0)=a$ and $f(1)=b$. Then we can identify the
        ordered pair $(a,b)$ with $f$. Indeed, $(a,b)=(f(0),f(1))$ making our
        identification very explicit. We can now generalize to a collection of
        $n$ different sets and define the ordered $n$ tuple over a collection of
        $n$ sets to be the set of all functions from $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ into the
        union over this collection with a similar property:
        \begin{equation}
            \prod_{k\in\mathbb{Z}_{n}}A_{k}
            =\big\{f:\mathbb{Z}_{n}\rightarrow\bigcup_{k\in\mathbb{Z}_{n}}^{n}
                A_{k}\;|\;f(k)\in{A}_{k}
                \textrm{for all }k\in\mathbb{Z}_{n}\big\}
        \end{equation}
        Given the function $f$ that maps $k$ to $a_{k}\in{A}_{k}$, we can
        identify $f$ with the ordered $n$ tuple:
        \begin{equation}
            f=(a_{0},\,a_{1},\,\dots,\,a_{k},\,\dots,\,a_{n-1})
            =(f(0),\,f(1),\,\dots,\,f(k),\,\dots,\,f(n-1))
        \end{equation}
        And thus we have a more general way of defining products. Note that
        swapping the order of the product is equivalent to changing functions,
        and thus we have that two $n$ tuples are equal if and only if all of
        their entries are equal. What's nice about our function definition is
        that it allows one to define products over \textit{arbitrary}
        collections. This is crucial for topology and analysis as we often wish
        to speak of \textit{infinite dimensional} spaces that are constructed
        using these abstract products. Given a set $I$, often called the
        \textit{index set}, such that for all $\mathcal{U}\in{I}$ it is true
        $\mathcal{U}$ is a set, we can form the product over $I$ by defining
        this to be the collection of all functions from $I$ into the union over
        $I$.
        \begin{equation}
            \prod_{i\in{I}}A_{i}
            =\big\{\,f:I\rightarrow\bigcup_{i\in{I}}A_{i}\;|\;
                f(i)\in{A}_{i}\textrm{ for all }i\in{I}\,\big\}
        \end{equation}
        The axiom of choice is thus equivalent to the statement
        \textit{The infinite product of non-empty sets is non-empty}. These
        functions that identify $k$ with the $k^{th}$ set are precisely
        choice functions. Phrasing it like this we see that the axiom of choice
        is somewhat obvious. The infinite product of non-empty sets is most
        likely enormous! Claiming it's non-empty thus seems trivial. It's thus
        unfortunate that this claim can not be proven with the other axioms
        we've developed. As stated before, the axiom of choice is equivalent to
        many other statements such as \textit{Zorn's lemma, Tychonoff's theorem,
        the well ordering theorem, every vector space has a basis, every set has
        a group structure}, and countless more. Many of these theorems have many
        applications to algebra, analysis, and topology, and since we would like
        to use them to prove other things we are forced to accept the axiom of
        choice. Many theorems in real analysis hide the use of the axiom of
        choice by constructing sequences \textit{by induction}. An attempt will
        be made to be very clear whenever the axiom of choice is used in a
        proof.
        \par\hfill\par
        We conclude this section by presenting Diaconescu's theorem.
        \begin{ftheorem}{Diaconescu's Theorem}{Diaconescus_Theorem}
            If $P$ is a proposition on sets and if $x$ is a set, then either
            $P(x)$ is true or $P(x)$ is false. That is, $P\lor\neg{P}$ is true.
        \end{ftheorem}
        \begin{bproof}
            Let $0=\emptyset$. By
            Thm.~\ref{thm:Existence_of_Set_Containing_Set}, we have that the set
            $\{0\}$ exists. Let $1=\{0\}$. Then since $0\in{1}$, $0\ne{1}$
            (Thm.~\ref{thm:Containment_NEqual_Underlying_Set}). Since $0$ and
            $1$ are sets, by Thm.~\ref{thm:Existence_of_Set_Built_from_Two_Sets}
            we have that the set $\{0,1\}$ exists. Let $Q$ be the proposition
            \textit{true if P(x) or } $x=0$, \textit{false otherwise}. By the
            axiom schema of specification
            (Ax.~\ref{ax:Axiom_Schema_of_Specification}) there exists a set
            $\mathcal{U}$ such that:
            \begin{equation}
                \mathcal{U}=\{\,x\in\{\,0,\,1\,\}\;|\;Q(x)\,\}
            \end{equation}
            Similarly, let $Q$ be the proposition \textit{true if P(x) or}
            $x=1$, \textit{false otherwise}. By the axiom schema of
            specification we have that the following set exists:
            \begin{equation}
                \mathcal{V}=\{\,x\in\{\,0,\,1\,\}\;|\;R(x)\,\}
            \end{equation}
            By Thm.~\ref{thm:Existence_of_Set_Built_from_Two_Sets}, we have that
            the set $\{\,\mathcal{U},\,\mathcal{V}\,\}$ exists. By the axiom of
            choice (Ax.~\ref{ax:Axiom_of_Choice}), there exists a function
            $f:\{\mathcal{U},\mathcal{V}\}\rightarrow%
             \bigcup\{\mathcal{U},\mathcal{V}\}$ such that
            $f(\mathcal{U})\in\mathcal{U}$ and $f(\mathcal{V})\in\mathcal{V}$.
            But then, by the definition of $\mathcal{U}$, either
            $f(\mathcal{U})=0$ or $P(x)$ is true. Similarly, either
            $f(\mathcal{V})=1$ or $P(x)$ is true. But since $0\ne{1}$, either
            $f(\mathcal{U})\ne{f}(\mathcal{V})$ or $P(x)$ is true. Again by the
            axiom of extensionality, and by the definition of $\mathcal{U}$ and
            $\mathcal{V}$, if $P(x)$ is true then $\mathcal{U}=\mathcal{V}$. But
            then $f(\mathcal{U})=f(\mathcal{V})$. But then, by the
            contrapositive, $\neg{P}(x)$ implies that
            $f(\mathcal{U})\ne{f}(\mathcal{V})$. But by extensionality, either
            $f(\mathcal{U})=f(\mathcal{V})$ or
            $f(\mathcal{U})\ne{f}(\mathcal{V})$, and thus either $P(x)$ or
            $\neg{P}(x)$. That is, $P\lor\neg{P}$ is true.
        \end{bproof}
        We can now prove things via \textit{proof by contradiction}. While we
        have made great efforts to justify every step of a proof thus far, we
        will often omit mention of Diaconescu's theorem as a justification for
        the law of the excluded middle and simply use it freely. We may rest
        easy knowing that we've proved the equivalence within the framework of
        ZFC. There are two more axioms remaining, that of infinity and
        replacement. The axiom of infinity is best introduced when we construct
        the natural numbers, and from there build the real numbers, and thus we
        shall delay its development briefly. The axiom of replacement needs a
        notion of class and thus will also be postponed.
