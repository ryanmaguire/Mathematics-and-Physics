\section{Connectives}
    In the set theory we will be working with, known as
    Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory (abbreviated as ZFC where C stands for
    \textit{choice}) there are a few words that are left undefined as well as a
    few symbols. This is certainly unavoidable since defining all words would
    ultimately be circular, and thus we try to leave the fewest amount of words
    and symbols undefined as possible, and build up everything else from this
    foundation. Our first undefined symbol is $\in$
    (known as \textit{containment}). This is a type of
    \textit{\gls{predicate}}\index{Predicate}.
    \begin{fdefinition}{Predicate}{Predicate}
        A \gls{predicate} is a statement that takes in some parameter or
        variable $x$ and returns either \textit{True} or \textit{True}.
    \end{fdefinition}
    We have relied on the word \textit{statement} being already defined, and
    similarly for the words \textit{parameter} or \textit{variable}. For most
    this is not an issue, but for some it may indicate that mathematics may rest
    on some shakey foundations.
    \par\hfill\par
    From our undefined symbol $\in$ we build new symbols by expressing them in
    terms of a \textit{formula}\index{Formula}, which is simply a finite
    sequence of symbols. Here the word \textit{sequence} is meant to imply that
    the \textit{order} in which we combine these symbols is important and that
    rearranging said order may create a different inequivalent formula. We build
    formulas by defining a few symbols that stand as placeholders for standard
    words in English. There are five symbols, called
    \textit{\glspl{connective}}\index{Connective (Logic)}, that we use.
    \begin{align*}
        a\land{b}\quad
        &\textrm{True if and only if }a
        \textrm{ is true and }b\textrm{ is true}
        \tag{Conjunction}\\
        a\lor{b}\quad
        &\textrm{True if and only if }a
        \textrm{ is true or }b\textrm{ is true, or both}
        \tag{Disjunction}\\
        \neg{a}\quad
        &\textrm{True if and only if }a\textrm{ is false}
        \tag{Negation}\\
        a\Leftrightarrow{b}\quad
        &a\textrm{ is true if and only if }b\textrm{ is true}
        \tag{Equivalence}\\
        a\Rightarrow{b}\quad
        &a\textrm{ is true implies that }b\textrm{ is true}
        \tag{Implication}
    \end{align*}
    From this we see that we have introduced 6 new words that are undefined but
    require comment. The words are \textit{and, or, if, then, true}, and
    \textit{false}. There are other symbols we could adopt, such as
    \textit{does not imply}:
    \begin{equation*}
        a\not\Rightarrow{b}
    \end{equation*}
    But from how we shall define these notions, this new symbol is equivalent to
    a combination of the previous ones:
    \begin{equation*}
        a\not\Rightarrow{b}\Longleftrightarrow
        \neg(a\Rightarrow{b})
        \Longleftrightarrow
        a\land\neg{b}
    \end{equation*}
    \subsection{Conjunction}
        The conjunction connective is the $\land$ symbol, which denotes the word
        \textit{and}. Given two propositions $P$ and $Q$, $P\land{Q}$ is a true
        statement if and only if both $P$ and $Q$ are true. That is, we
        associate to $\land$ the following truth table:
        \begin{table}[H]
            \centering
            \captionsetup{type=table}
            \begin{tabular}{ccc}
                $P$&$Q$&$P\land{Q}$\\
                \hline
                0&0&0\\
                0&1&0\\
                1&0&0\\
                1&1&1
            \end{tabular}
            \caption{Truth Table for Conjunction}
            \label{tab:Truth_Table_for_Conjunction}
        \end{table}
        There are several \textit{axioms} of conjunctions that are intuitively
        obvious, but must be stated since their use is wide spread.
        \begin{faxiom}{Axioms of Conjunction}{Axioms_of_Conjunction}
            If $P$ and $Q$ are propositions, then the following are true:
            \begin{align}
                P\land{Q}&\Longleftrightarrow{Q}\land{P}
                \tag{Commutativity of Conjunction}\\
                P\land\textrm{True}&\Longleftrightarrow\textrm{P}
                \tag{Identity of Conjunction}
            \end{align}
        \end{faxiom}
    \subsection{Disjunction}
        The disjunction connected is the $\lor$ symbol which represents
        \textit{or}. Given two propositions $P$ and $Q$, $P\lor{Q}$ is true if
        and only if $P$ is true, or $Q$ is true, or both $P$ and $Q$ is true.
        There is an unfortunate ambiguity in English as to whether $P$ or $Q$
        means $P$ is true or $Q$ is true, but not both, or whether it means
        $P$ is true or $Q$ is true, or \textit{both} are true. The convention is
        to adopt the latter definition. That is, $P\lor{Q}$ has the following
        truth table:
        \begin{table}[H]
            \centering
            \captionsetup{type=table}
            \begin{tabular}{ccc}
                $P$&$Q$&$P\lor{Q}$\\
                \hline
                0&0&0\\
                0&1&1\\
                1&0&1\\
                1&1&1
            \end{tabular}
            \caption{Truth Table for Disjunction}
            \label{tab:Truth_Table_for_Disjunction}
        \end{table}
    \subsection{Implication}
        The implication connective is denoted by $P\Rightarrow{Q}$. This is read
        as \textit{if P, then Q} for two given propositions $P$ and $Q$. Here,
        $P$ is called the \textit{hypothesis} and $Q$ is called the
        \textit{conclusion}. There is some ambiguity as to the mean of if-then
        statements. If $P$ is a proposition that is false, and $Q$ is a
        propositions that is true, should $P\Rightarrow{Q}$ be a true statement
        or a false one? The convention is to take this as true. That is, we
        adopt the following truth table.
        \begin{table}[H]
            \centering
            \captionsetup{type=table}
            \begin{tabular}{ccc}
                $P$&$Q$&$P\Rightarrow{Q}$\\
                \hline
                0&0&1\\
                0&1&1\\
                1&0&0\\
                1&1&1
            \end{tabular}
            \caption{Truth Table for Implication}
            \label{tab:Truth_Table_for_Implication}
        \end{table}
        The converse of the statement $P\Rightarrow{Q}$ is the statement
        $Q\Rightarrow{P}$. The validity of the converse is not implied by the
        truth or falsehood of $P\Rightarrow{Q}$, and we need only look at the
        truth table to see this.
        \begin{table}[H]
            \centering
            \captionsetup{type=table}
            \begin{tabular}{cccc}
                $P$&$Q$&$P\Rightarrow{Q}$&$Q\Rightarrow{P}$\\
                \hline
                0&0&1&1\\
                0&1&1&0\\
                1&0&0&1\\
                1&1&1&1
            \end{tabular}
            \caption{Truth Table for the Converse}
            \label{tab:Truth_Table_for_Converse}
        \end{table}
        Examining this, we see that there are scenarios where $P\Rightarrow{Q}$
        is true and $Q\Rightarrow{P}$ is false, and similarly where
        $P\Rightarrow{Q}$ is false and $Q\Rightarrow{P}$ is true. Propositions
        $P$ and $Q$ such that $P\Rightarrow{Q}$ and $Q\Rightarrow{P}$ are called
        \textit{equivalent}, and great deal of mathematics is devoted to the
        search for equivalencies of statements. This is denoted by the
        connective $P\Leftrightarrow{Q}$. We see that this is a redundant
        connective and can be written in terms of implication and conjunction:
        \begin{equation}
            \big(P\Leftrightarrow{Q}\big)\Longleftrightarrow
            \big(P\Rightarrow{Q}\big)\land\big(Q\Rightarrow{P}\big)
        \end{equation}
        To verify this, we examine the truth tables.
        \begin{table}[H]
            \centering
            \captionsetup{type=table}
            \begin{tabular}{cccccc}
                $P$&$Q$&$P\Rightarrow{Q}$&$Q\Rightarrow{P}$
                   &$P\Leftrightarrow{Q}$
                   &$(P\Rightarrow{Q})\land{Q\Rightarrow{P}}$\\
                \hline
                0&0&1&1&1&1\\
                0&1&1&0&0&1\\
                1&0&0&1&0&1\\
                1&1&1&1&1&1
            \end{tabular}
            \caption{Truth Table for Equivalence}
            \label{tab:Truth_Table_for_Equivalence}
        \end{table}
    \subsection{Negation}
        Negation is the first connective we come across that is a \textit{unary}
        operation. That is, it only takes in one proposition rather than two.
        Given a proposition $P$, $\neg{P}$ is true if and only if $P$ if false.
        That is, we have the following truth table.
        \begin{table}[H]
            \centering
            \captionsetup{type=table}
            \begin{tabular}{cc}
                $P$&$\neg{P}$\\
                \hline
                0&1\\
                1&0
            \end{tabular}
            \caption{Truth Table for Negation}
            \label{tab:Truth_Table_for_Negation}
        \end{table}
        The negation connective always us to define the
        \textit{contrapositive}\index{Contrapositive} of the proposition
        $P\Rightarrow{Q}$, which is the new proposition
        $\neg{Q}\Rightarrow\neg{P}$. As it turns out, this is not a new
        proposition at all and is equivalent to $P\Rightarrow{Q}$. To see this,
        note that $P\Rightarrow{Q}$ is only false when $P$ is true, yet $Q$ is
        false. Similarly, $\neg{Q}\Rightarrow\ne{P}$ is only false when
        $\neg{Q}$ is true and $\neg{P}$ is false. But if $\neg{Q}$ is true, then
        $Q$ is false, and if $\neg{P}$ is false, then $P$ is true. Thus
        $\neg{Q}\Rightarrow\neg{P}$ is only false when $P$ is true and $Q$ is
        false. We can further examine this by the truth tables of these
        statements.
        \begin{table}[H]
            \centering
            \captionsetup{type=table}
            \begin{tabular}{cccccc}
                $P$&$Q$&$\neg{P}$&$\neg{Q}$
                    &$P\Rightarrow{Q}$&$\neg{Q}\Rightarrow\neg{P}$\\
                \hline
                0&0&1&1&1&1\\
                0&1&1&0&1&1\\
                1&0&0&1&0&0\\
                1&1&0&0&1&1
            \end{tabular}
            \caption{Truth Table for the Contrapositive}
            \label{tab:Truth_Table_for_Contrapositive}
        \end{table}
    \subsection{Quantifiers}
        There are two more symbols called
        \textit{\glspl{quantifier}}\index{Quantifier}.
        \begin{equation*}
            \forall_{x}\quad\textrm{For all }x
            \quad\quad\quad\quad
            \exists_{x}\quad\textrm{There exists }x
        \end{equation*}
        Quantifiers, together with connectives, the word \textit{set}, and the
        $\in$ symbol are combined to define new terms and new symbols. The rest
        of mathematics rests on trusting ones intuition behind these notions.
