\section{Connectives}
    In the set theory we will be working with there are a few words and symbols
    that are left undefined. This is certainly unavoidable since defining
    everything would ultimately be circular, and thus we try to leave the fewest
    number \textit{primitive notions} as possible. Everything else is then built
    from this collection of words that we agree are obvious from an intuitive
    point of view. The main undefined symbol in set theory is that of
    \textit{containment} (\gls{containmentsymb}). This is
    a type of \textit{\gls{predicate}}\index{Predicate}.
    \begin{fdefinition}{Predicate}{Predicate}
        A \gls{predicate} is a statement that takes in some parameter or
        variable $x$ and returns either \textit{True} or \textit{False}.
    \end{fdefinition}
    We have relied on the word \textit{statement} being already defined, and
    similarly for the words \textit{parameter} or \textit{variable}. For most
    this is not an issue, but it may irk others. From our undefined symbol $\in$
    we build new symbols by expressing them in terms of a
    \textit{formula}\index{Formula}, which is simply a finite
    sequence of symbols. Here the word \textit{sequence} is meant to imply that
    the \textit{order} in which we combine these symbols is important and that
    rearranging said order may create a different inequivalent formula. We build
    formulas by defining a few symbols that stand as placeholders for standard
    words in English. There are four symbols, called
    \textit{\glspl{connective}}\index{Connective (Logic)}, that we use.
    \begin{align*}
        a\land{b}\quad
        &\textrm{True if and only if }a
        \textrm{ is true and }b\textrm{ is true}
        \tag{Conjunction}\\
        a\lor{b}\quad
        &\textrm{True if and only if }a
        \textrm{ is true or }b\textrm{ is true, or both}
        \tag{Disjunction}\\
        \neg{a}\quad
        &\textrm{True if and only if }a\textrm{ is false}
        \tag{Negation}\\
        a\Rightarrow{b}\quad
        &a\textrm{ is true implies that }b\textrm{ is true}
        \tag{Implication}
    \end{align*}
    From this we see that we have introduced 6 new words that are undefined but
    require comment. The words are \textit{and, or, if, then, true}, and
    \textit{false}. There are other symbols we could adopt, such as
    \textit{equivalence}:
    \begin{equation*}
        a\Leftrightarrow{b}
    \end{equation*}
    But from how we shall define these notions, this new symbol is equivalent to
    a combination of the previous ones:
    \begin{equation*}
        \Big(\big(a\Leftrightarrow{b}\big)\Rightarrow
             \big((a\Rightarrow{b})\land(b\Rightarrow{a})\big)\Big)
        \land\Big(\big((a\Rightarrow{b})\land(b\Rightarrow{A})\big)
            \Rightarrow\big(a\Leftrightarrow{b}\big)\Big)
    \end{equation*}
    That is, $a\Leftrightarrow{b}$ if and only if $a$ is true if and only if $b$
    is true. Similarly, we could define \textit{does not imply}:
    \begin{equation*}
        a\not\Rightarrow{b}
    \end{equation*}
    But this is the same as:
    \begin{equation*}
        a\not\Rightarrow{b}\Longleftrightarrow
        \neg(a\Rightarrow{b})
        \Longleftrightarrow
        a\land\neg{b}
    \end{equation*}
    The words true and false are assumed to be well defined. They are also
    assumed to be opposites of each other (which we will define in terms of
    negation). We will use truth tables\index{Truth Table} to define what
    various connectives mean when it is known that certain propositions are true
    or false. In such tables the symbol 0 represents that a proposition is false
    and the symbol 1 represents truth.
    \par\hfill\par
    The other four words can be ambiguous in their everyday usage which we
    cannot allow for in mathematics. As such we must specify what we mean when
    we use these words and rid of any such ambiguity.
    \subsection{Conjunction}
        The conjunction connective (\gls{conjunctionsymb}) is used to denote the
        word \textit{and}. Given two propositions $P$ and $Q$, $P\land{Q}$ is a true
        statement if and only if both $P$ and $Q$ are true. That is, we
        associate to $\land$ the following truth table:
        \begin{table}[H]
            \centering
            \captionsetup{type=table}
            \begin{tabular}{ccc}
                $P$&$Q$&$P\land{Q}$\\
                \hline
                0&0&0\\
                0&1&0\\
                1&0&0\\
                1&1&1
            \end{tabular}
            \caption{Truth Table for Conjunction}
            \label{tab:Truth_Table_for_Conjunction}
        \end{table}
        There are several \textit{axioms} of conjunctions that are intuitively
        obvious, but must be stated since their use is wide spread.
        \begin{faxiom}{Axioms of Conjunction}{Axioms_of_Conjunction}
            If $P$ and $Q$ are propositions, then the following are true:
            \begin{align}
                P\land{Q}&\Longleftrightarrow{Q}\land{P}
                \tag{Commutativity of Conjunction}\\
                P\land\textrm{True}&\Longleftrightarrow\textrm{P}
                \tag{Identity of Conjunction}
            \end{align}
        \end{faxiom}
    \subsection{Disjunction}
        The disjunction connective (\gls{disjunctionsymb}) represents the word
        \textit{or}. Given two propositions $P$ and $Q$, $P\lor{Q}$ is true if
        and only if $P$ is true, or $Q$ is true, or both $P$ and $Q$ are true.
        There is an unfortunate ambiguity in English as to whether $P$ or $Q$
        means $P$ is true or $Q$ is true, but not both, or whether it means
        $P$ is true or $Q$ is true, or \textit{both} are true. The convention is
        to adopt the latter definition. That is, $P\lor{Q}$ has the following
        truth table:
        \begin{table}[H]
            \centering
            \captionsetup{type=table}
            \begin{tabular}{ccc}
                $P$&$Q$&$P\lor{Q}$\\
                \hline
                0&0&0\\
                0&1&1\\
                1&0&1\\
                1&1&1
            \end{tabular}
            \caption{Truth Table for Disjunction}
            \label{tab:Truth_Table_for_Disjunction}
        \end{table}
        There is another connective called the \textit{exlusive} or, which is
        defined to be false if both $P$ and $Q$ are true. The symbol $\lor$ is
        strictly used to denote the inclusive or. That is, the word or as
        represented by the truth table in
        Tab.~\ref{tab:Truth_Table_for_Disjunction}.
    \subsection{Implication}
        The implication connective is denoted by $P\Rightarrow{Q}$. This is read
        as \textit{if P, then Q} for two given propositions $P$ and $Q$. Here,
        $P$ is called the \textit{hypothesis} and $Q$ is called the
        \textit{conclusion}. There is potential ambiguity as to the meaning of
        if-then statements. If $P$ is a proposition that is false, and $Q$ is a
        propositions that is true, should $P\Rightarrow{Q}$ be a true statement
        or a false one? The convention is to take this as true. That is, we
        adopt the following truth table.
        \begin{table}[H]
            \centering
            \captionsetup{type=table}
            \begin{tabular}{ccc}
                $P$&$Q$&$P\Rightarrow{Q}$\\
                \hline
                0&0&1\\
                0&1&1\\
                1&0&0\\
                1&1&1
            \end{tabular}
            \caption{Truth Table for Implication}
            \label{tab:Truth_Table_for_Implication}
        \end{table}
        The converse of the statement $P\Rightarrow{Q}$ is the statement
        $Q\Rightarrow{P}$. The validity of the converse is not implied by the
        truth or falsehood of $P\Rightarrow{Q}$, and we need only look at the
        truth table to see this.
        \begin{table}[H]
            \centering
            \captionsetup{type=table}
            \begin{tabular}{cccc}
                $P$&$Q$&$P\Rightarrow{Q}$&$Q\Rightarrow{P}$\\
                \hline
                0&0&1&1\\
                0&1&1&0\\
                1&0&0&1\\
                1&1&1&1
            \end{tabular}
            \caption{Truth Table for the Converse}
            \label{tab:Truth_Table_for_Converse}
        \end{table}
        Examining, we see that there are scenarios where $P\Rightarrow{Q}$
        is true and $Q\Rightarrow{P}$ is false, and similarly where
        $P\Rightarrow{Q}$ is false and $Q\Rightarrow{P}$ is true. Propositions
        $P$ and $Q$ such that $P\Rightarrow{Q}$ and $Q\Rightarrow{P}$ are called
        \textit{equivalent}, and great deal of mathematics is devoted to the
        search for equivalencies of statements. This is denoted by the
        connective $P\Leftrightarrow{Q}$. Equivalence has the following truth
        table:
        \begin{table}[H]
            \centering
            \captionsetup{type=table}
            \begin{tabular}{cccccc}
                $P$&$Q$&$P\Rightarrow{Q}$&$Q\Rightarrow{P}$
                   &$P\Leftrightarrow{Q}$
                   &$(P\Rightarrow{Q})\land(Q\Rightarrow{P})$\\
                \hline
                0&0&1&1&1&1\\
                0&1&1&0&0&0\\
                1&0&0&1&0&0\\
                1&1&1&1&1&1
            \end{tabular}
            \caption{Truth Table for Equivalence}
            \label{tab:Truth_Table_for_Equivalence}
        \end{table}
    \subsection{Negation}
        Negation is the first connective we come across that is a \textit{unary}
        operation. That is, it only takes in one proposition rather than two.
        Given a proposition $P$, $\neg{P}$ is true if and only if $P$ if false.
        That is, we have the following truth table.
        \begin{table}[H]
            \centering
            \captionsetup{type=table}
            \begin{tabular}{cc}
                $P$&$\neg{P}$\\
                \hline
                0&1\\
                1&0
            \end{tabular}
            \caption{Truth Table for Negation}
            \label{tab:Truth_Table_for_Negation}
        \end{table}
        The negation connective allows us to define the
        \textit{contrapositive}\index{Contrapositive} of the proposition
        $P\Rightarrow{Q}$, which is the new proposition
        $\neg{Q}\Rightarrow\neg{P}$. As it turns out, this is not a new
        proposition at all and is equivalent to $P\Rightarrow{Q}$. To see this,
        note that $P\Rightarrow{Q}$ is only false when $P$ is true, yet $Q$ is
        false. Similarly, $\neg{Q}\Rightarrow\neg{P}$ is only false when
        $\neg{Q}$ is true and $\neg{P}$ is false. But if $\neg{Q}$ is true, then
        $Q$ is false, and if $\neg{P}$ is false, then $P$ is true. Thus
        $\neg{Q}\Rightarrow\neg{P}$ is only false when $P$ is true and $Q$ is
        false. We can further examine this by the truth tables of these
        statements.
        \begin{table}[H]
            \centering
            \captionsetup{type=table}
            \begin{tabular}{cccccc}
                $P$&$Q$&$\neg{P}$&$\neg{Q}$
                    &$P\Rightarrow{Q}$&$\neg{Q}\Rightarrow\neg{P}$\\
                \hline
                0&0&1&1&1&1\\
                0&1&1&0&1&1\\
                1&0&0&1&0&0\\
                1&1&0&0&1&1
            \end{tabular}
            \caption{Truth Table for the Contrapositive}
            \label{tab:Truth_Table_for_Contrapositive}
        \end{table}
        \begin{example}
            Suppose $a$ and $b$ are variables representing real numbers and $P$
            is the proposition $a<1/2$ and $b<1/2$, and let $Q$ be the
            proposition $a+b<1$. What is the contrapositive of
            $P\Rightarrow{Q}$? This would be $\neg{Q}\Rightarrow\neg{P}$, and
            $\neg{Q}$ is the negation of $Q$, which reads $a+b\geq{1}$.
            Similarly, $\neg{P}$ is the statement $a\geq{1}/2$ or $b\geq{1}/2$.
            Thus, the contrapositive says that if $a+b\geq{1}$, then either
            $a\geq{1}/2$ or $b\geq{1}/2$ (or both). While the contrapositive of
            a statement is always equivalent to the original statement, the
            converse need not be. Indeed, this statement is true (once one knows
            the order structure of real numbers), but the converse is not. The
            converse states that if $a+b<1$, then $a<1/2$ and $b<1/2$, but
            letting $a=2$ and $b=\minus{3}$ contradicts this claim.
        \end{example}
