\section{Sequences and Matrices}
    Matrices\index{Matrix} are the fundamental object studied in
    linear algebra\index{Linear Algebra}, and are used in the study of general
    algebra as well. To discuss the more interesting properties requires some
    notion of arithmetic that we do not yet posses. In particular, matrices are
    most interesting when there is an underlying \textit{ring}\index{Ring}
    structure. For now we simply introduce the set theoretic definition of a
    matrix, relate this to the familiar \textit{grid of numbers} definition, and
    provide examples.
    \begin{fdefinition}{Matrix}
        An $n\times{m}$, $n,m\in\mathbb{N}$, matrix on a set $X$ is a function
        $A:\mathbb{Z}_{n}\times\mathbb{Z}_{m}\rightarrow{X}$.
