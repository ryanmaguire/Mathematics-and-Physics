    \chapter{Logic}
        This chapter provides preliminary material for the rest of the text and
        discusses how the English language is be used to formulate mathematics.

    \chapter{Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory}
        We'll start from the basics and develop mathematics from an axiomatic
        standpoint, adopting as truths the few postulates of Zermelo and
        Fraenkel. We'll then add the axiom of choice to our toolbelt and
        proceed from there to define and prove many of the basic and familiar
        results and concepts of mathematics. It is important not to take
        anything for granted even if something seems obvious. The existence of
        many sets will be proved, rather than accepting these things as trivial
        truths.

    \chapter{Function Theory}
        Functions serve as a basic tool for studying mathematics, so much so
        that it is often taken as fundamental and no definition is given. We've
        adopted the definition that a function\index{Function} from a set $A$ to
        a set $B$, $f:A\rightarrow{B}$, is a subset of the Cartesian product
        $A\times{B}$ with a few properties. We now take the time to examine the
        implications of this definition.
