    \chapter{Logic}
        This chapter serves as providing preliminary material for the rest of
        the text and discussing how the English language will be used to
        formulate mathematics.

    \chapter{Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory}
        We'll start from the basics and develop mathematics from an axiomatic
        standpoint, adopting as truths the few postulates of Zermelo and
        Fraenkel. We'll then add the axiom of choice to our toolbelt and
        proceed from there to define and prove many of the basic and familiar
        results and concepts of mathematics. It is important not to take
        anything for granted even if something seems obvious. The existence of
        many sets will be proved, rather than accepting these things as trivial
        truths.
