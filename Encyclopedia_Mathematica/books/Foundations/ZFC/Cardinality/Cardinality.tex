\section{Cardinality}
    We begin by talking about cardinality. This is the \textit{size} of a set.
    For an infinite set it doesn't make sense to talk about the \textit{number}
    of elements, but we can specify what it means two sets to have the same
    size. Sets $A$ and $B$ are equivalent if there exists a bijection
    $f:A\rightarrow{B}$. We then say that $A$ and $B$ have the same cardinality.
    The notation is written as $|A|=|B|$ or $\Card(A)=\Card(B)$. A finite set is
    a set $A$ such that there is a bijection between $A$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$.
    We can then view the elements of $A$ as $A=\{a_{1},\hdots,a_{n}\}$. A
    countable set is a set $A$ such that there is a bijection between $A$ and
    $\mathbb{N}$. Here, $\mathbb{N}$ is the set of all natural numbers, or
    positive integers.
    \begin{ldefinition}{Equivalent Sets}{Equivalent_Sets}
        Equivalent sets are set $A$ and $B$ such that there exists a bijection
        $f:A\rightarrow{B}$.
    \end{ldefinition}
    The notion of equivalent sets defines an equivalence relation on sets. That
    is, the notion is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.
    \begin{theorem}
        If $A$ is a set, then $A$ is equivalent to $A$.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        For let $\mathrm{id}_{A}:A\rightarrow{A}$ be the identity mapping,
        $\mathrm{id}_{A}(x)=x$, then $\mathrm{id}_{A}$ is a bijection, and thus
        $A$ is equivalent to $A$.
    \end{proof}
    \begin{theorem}
        If $A$ and $B$ are sets and if $A$ is equivalent to $B$, then $B$ is
        equivalent to $A$.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        For if $A$ is equivalent to $B$, then there is a bijection
        $f:A\rightarrow{B}$. But if $f$ is a bijection, then the inverse
        function $f^{-1}:B\rightarrow{A}$ is well-defined and is a bijection.
        Thus $B$ is equivalent to $A$.
    \end{proof}
    \begin{theorem}
        If $A$, $B$, and $C$ are sets, if $A$ is equivalent to $B$, and if $B$
        is equivalent to $C$, then $A$ is equivalent to $C$.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        For if $A$ is equivalent to $B$, then there is a bijection
        $f:A\rightarrow{B}$. But if $B$ is equivalent ot $C$, then there is a
        bijection $g:B\rightarrow{C}$. But then $g\circ{f}:A\rightarrow{C}$ is a
        bijection, and thus $A$ and $C$ are equivalent.
    \end{proof}
    A bijection is a function that is both injective and surjective. Thus, two
    equivalent sets can be put into a one-to-one correspondence and can be said
    to have the same size. We then say that $A$ and $B$ have the same
    cardinality. The notation is written as $|A|=|B|$ or $\Card(A)=\Card(B)$.
    Cardinality splits sets into one of three categories.
    \begin{ldefinition}{Finite Sets}{Finite_Sets}
        A finite set is a set $A$ such that there exists
        an $n\in\mathbb{N}$ such that there is a
        bijection $f:\mathbb{Z}_{n}\rightarrow{A}$, or
        such that $A=\emptyset$.
    \end{ldefinition}
    Sets that are not finite are called infinite. There
    are two types of infinite sets. Let $\mathbb{N}$
    denote the set of positive integers, or
    \textit{natural} numbers.
    \begin{ldefinition}{Countably Infinite Sets}
          {Countably_Infinite}
        A countably infinite set is a set $A$ such that
        is a bijection $f:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow{A}$.
    \end{ldefinition}
    Combining the notions of finite sets and countably
    infinite sets, we get the notion of
    \textit{countable} sets.
    \begin{ldefinition}{Countable Sets}
          {Countable_Sets}
        A countable set is a set $A$ such that $A$ is
        either finite or countably infinite.
    \end{ldefinition}
    Countable sets are also called \textit{listable}.
    This is because if $A$ is a countably infinite set,
    and if $a:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow{A}$ is a bijection,
    we can write $A$ as:
    \begin{equation}
        A=\{\;a_{n}\,:\,n\in\mathbb{N}\;\}
        =\{\,a_{1},\,a_{2},\,\dots,\,a_{k},\,\dots\,\}
    \end{equation}
    If $A$ is finite, and if
    $a:\mathbb{Z}_{n}\rightarrow{A}$ is a
    bijection, then we can write:
    \begin{equation}
        A=\{\;a_{n}\,:\,n\in\mathbb{Z}_{n}\;\}
         =\{\,a_{1},\,\dots,\,a_{n}\,\}
    \end{equation}
    Recall that functions $a:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow{A}$
    are called \textit{sequences}, and the image of
    $n\in\mathbb{N}$ is written $a_{n}$, rather than
    $a(n)$.
    \begin{example}
        The set of all positive even integers is
        countable. For let $\mathbb{N}_{e}$ be the
        set of all even integers and define
        $f:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{N}_{e}$ be
        $f(n)=2n$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$. This is
        a bijection, and thus $\mathbb{N}_{e}$ is
        countable. The set of all odd positive integers
        is countable, as shown by letting
        $f(n)=2n-1$. Even though the set of even
        integers may seem ``smaller,'' than the set of
        all integers, they are equivalent. The set of
        all integers $\mathbb{Z}$ is also countable.
        For let $f:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}$
        be defined as:
        \begin{equation}
            f(n)=
            \begin{cases}
                \frac{1}{2}(n-1),&n\textrm{ odd}\\
                -\frac{n}{2},&n\textrm{ even}
            \end{cases}
        \end{equation}
    \end{example}
    Any set that is infinite (Not finite) contains a
    countable subset. Thus, $\mathbb{N}$ can be
    considered as the \textit{smallest} infinite set.
    \begin{theorem}
        If $A$ is an infinite set, then there exists
        $S\subseteq{A}$ such that $S$ is countable.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        For as $A$ is infinite, for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$
        there exists a set $B\subseteq{A}$ such that
        $|B|=n$. For all $n\in\mathbb{N}$,
        define the following:
        \begin{equation}
            \mathcal{S}_{n}=\{B\subseteq{A}:|B|=n\}
        \end{equation}
        Let $\mathcal{S}$ be defined as:
        \begin{equation}
            \mathcal{S}=\{\mathcal{S}_{n}:n\in\mathbb{N}\}
        \end{equation}
        Then $\mathcal{S}$ is countable, for
        $a:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathcal{S}$ defined
        by $a_{n}=\mathcal{S}_{n}$ is a bijection.
        By the axiom of choice, there is a function:
        \begin{equation}
            \alpha:\mathcal{S}\rightarrow
            \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}\mathcal{S}_{n}
        \end{equation}
        Such that, for all $x\in\mathcal{S}$,
        $\alpha(x)\in{x}$. But then, for all
        $x\in\mathcal{S}$, $\alpha(x)$ is a subset
        of $A$. But for all $x\in\mathcal{S}$, there
        is an $n\in\mathbb{N}$ such that
        $a_{n}=x$. Thus, let $S$ be the following:
        \begin{equation}
            S=\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}\alpha(a_{n})
        \end{equation}
    \end{proof}
    In the absence of the requirement that $a\cap{b}=\emptyset$ for all
    pairs in $\mathcal{U}$, we still have that the union is, at most,
    countable. The mapping we found would be a \textit{surjection}, rather
    than a bijection. The union is then either finite or countable. The
    Cantor-Schr\"{o}der-Bernstein Theorem can often be used to help identify
    the size of a set. This says that if $A$ and $B$ are sets such that
    there exists a surjective function $f:A\rightarrow{B}$ and a surjective
    function $g:B\rightarrow{A}$, then there is a bijective function
    $h:A\rightarrow{B}$. The requirement that $f$ and $g$ both be surjective
    can be replaced with the requirement that they both be injective. This
    is similar to saying that if $\Card(A)\leq\Card(B)$ and
    $\Card(B)\leq\Card(A)$, then $\Card(A)=\Card(B)$. Here, $\Card(A)$
    denotes the \textit{cardinality} of the set $A$.
    \begin{lexample}{Countable Sets}{Countable_Sets}
        There are many commonly discussed sets that are
        countably infinite. $\mathbb{N}$ is a trivial
        such example, but also $\mathbb{N}_{e}$ and
        $\mathbb{N}_{o}$, the sets of even and odd
        positive integers, respectively. For consider as
        bijections the following functions:
        \par
        \begin{subequations}
            \begin{minipage}[b]{0.49\textwidth}
                \centering
                \begin{equation}
                    f_{e}(n)=2n

                \end{equation}
            \end{minipage}
            \par\vspace{2.5ex}
            The set of all integers, $\mathbb{Z}$ is also
            countable, as shown in
            Fig.~\ref{fig:Bijection_N_and_Z}.
            One bijection is:
            \begin{equation}
                f(n)=
                \begin{cases}
                    \frac{n}{2},&n\mod{2}=0\\
                    \frac{1-n}{2},&n\mod{2}=1
                \end{cases}
            \end{equation}
        \end{subequations}
        Any subset of $\mathbb{Z}$ is countable,
        and this is true of any countable set.

    One of the standard results about countable sets is
    that their subsets are also countable. This theorem
    relies, in a very subtle way, the use of the axiom
    of choice. There are a few stepping stones to get
    there. We will accept the various
    Cantor-Schr\"{o}eder-Bernstein theorems, which say
    the following:
    \begin{ltheorem}
          {First Cantor-Schr\"{o}eder-Bernstein Theorem}
          {First_Cantor_Schroeder_Bernstein}
        If $A$ and $B$ are sets such that there is an injective
        function $f:A\rightarrow{B}$ and an injective function
        $g:B\rightarrow{A}$, then there is a bijective function
        $h:A\rightarrow{B}$.
    \end{ltheorem}
    \begin{ltheorem}
          {Second Cantor-Schr\"{o}eder-Bernstein Theorem}
          {Second_Cantor_Schroeder_Bernstein}
        If $A$ and $B$ are sets such that there is a surjective
        function $f:A\rightarrow{B}$ and a surjective function
        $g:B\rightarrow{A}$, then there is a bijective function
        $h:A\rightarrow{B}$.
    \end{ltheorem}
    \par\hfill\par
    Using cardinalities, this says that if
    $\Card(A)\leq\Card(B)$ and $\Card(B)\leq\Card(A)$, then
    $\Card(A)=\Card(B)$. With this notation it becomes more
    intuitive. We will use this to prove that various sets are
    countable. Many sets that appear to be larger than $\mathbb{N}$
    can shown to to be the same size as $\mathbb{N}$ by finding
    a simple injective function, without finding an explicit
    bijection.
    \begin{ltheorem}
          {Third Cantor-Schr\"{o}eder-Bernstein Theorem}
          {Third_Cantor_Schroeder_Bernstein}
        If $A$, $B$, and $C$ are sets such that
        $A\subseteq{B}\subseteq{C}$, and if $A$ and $C$ are equivalent
        sets, then $B$ and $C$ are equivalent sets.
    \end{ltheorem}
    \par\hfill\par
    This says that if $\Card(A)\leq\Card(B)\leq\Card(C)$,
    and if $\Card(A)=\Card(C)$, then $\Card(B)=\Card(C)$.
    \begin{theorem}
        \label{thm:Measure_Theory_NxN_Is_Countable}
        $\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}$ is countably infinite.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        There is a trivial injection
        $f:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}$
        defined by:
        \begin{equation}
            f(n)=(n,0)
        \end{equation}
        There is also an injection
        $g:\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$
        defined by:
        \begin{equation}
            g(n.m)=2^{n}3^{m}
        \end{equation}
        Since 2 and 3 are co-prime, if
        $g(n_{1},m_{1})=g(n_{2},m_{2})$, then
        $(n_{1},m_{1})=(n_{2},m_{2})$. Thus, $g$ is an injection.
        By the Cantor-Schr\"{o}eder-Bernstein Theorem, there is a
        bijection $h:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}$.
    \end{proof}
    One can intuitively see that the set of all positive
    rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}^{+}$ is countable by examining
    the zig-zag pattern shown in
    Fig.~\ref{fig:Bijection_N_and_Q_Plus}.
    Thm.~\ref{thm:Measure_Theory_NxN_Is_Countable} also
    shows this in a more rigorous way that. We can create
    a one-to-one correspondence with
    $\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}$ by mapping
    $pq^{\minus{1}}\mapsto(p,q)$. Thus $\mathbb{Q}^{+}$
    and $\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}$ are equivalent sets.
    But $\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{N}$
    are equivalent sets, and therefore $\mathbb{Q}^{+}$
    is countable.
    Thm.~\ref{thm:Measure_Theory_NxN_Is_Countable} can also be used
    to show that the countable union of countable sets is also
    countable.
    \begin{ltheorem}{Equivalence of Countable Sets}
          {Countable_iff_exists_inj_to_N}
        A set $A$ is countable if and only if there is an injective
        function $f:A\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$.
    \end{ltheorem}
    Thm.~\ref{thm:Countable_iff_exists_inj_to_N} seems
    intuitively obvious, the injective function is
    simply the listing function. For a finite set, this
    is precisely how one constructs such an injection.
    For an infinite set $A$, this is equivalent to
    showing that any infinite subset of $\mathbb{N}$ is
    equivalent to $\mathbb{N}$. The standard proof
    using \textit{induction}, but actually has the axiom
    of choice underlying it.
    \begin{theorem}
        If $\mathcal{A}$ is a countably infinite set
        such that, for all $A\in\mathcal{A}$, $A$ is
        a non-empty countable set, then the set:
        \begin{equation}
            S=\bigcup_{A\in\mathcal{A}}A
        \end{equation}
        Is a countable set.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        If $\mathcal{F}$ is finite, then we are done. Suppose not.
        Let $A:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathcal{A}$ be a bijection,
        and define:
        \begin{equation}
            S=\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb{N}}A_{n}
        \end{equation}
        Also, let:
        \begin{equation}
            \mathcal{F}_{n}
            =\{f:A_{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{N}:
                f\textrm{ is injective}\}
        \end{equation}
        Since, for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$, $A_{n}$ is
        non-empty and countable, $\mathcal{F}_{n}$
        is non-empty. Let:
        \begin{equation}
            \mathcal{F}
            =\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\mathcal{F}_{n}
        \end{equation}
        Thus, by the axiom of choice, there is a function
        $F:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathcal{F}$ such that, for all
        $n\in\mathbb{N}$, $F_{n}\in\mathcal{F}_{n}$. For
        $x\in{S}$, let:
        \begin{equation}
            \varphi_{x}
            =\inf\{n\in\mathbb{N}:x\in{A}_{n}\}
        \end{equation}
        By the well-ordering of $\mathbb{N}$, for all
        $x\in{S}$, $\varphi_{x}$ is well defined. Let
        $\phi:S\rightarrow\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}$
        be defined by:
        \begin{equation}
            \phi(x)
            =\big(\varphi_{x},F_{\varphi_{x}}(x)\big)
        \end{equation}
        Then $\phi$ is an injection. For if
        $\big(\varphi_{x},F_{\varphi_{x}}(x)\big)=%
         \big(\varphi_{y},F_{\varphi_{x}}(y)\big)$, then
        $\varphi_{x}=\varphi_{y}$, and thus
        $F_{\varphi(x)}(x)=F_{\varphi(x)}(y)$. But
        $F_{\varphi_{x}}$ is an injection, and
        thus $x=y$. Therefore $\phi$ is an injection.
        But $\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{N}$
        are equivalent sets, and thus there's an
        injection $f:\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}$. And
        the composition of injective functions is again
        injective, and thus
        $\phi\circ{f}:S\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$ is an
        injective function. But by
        Thm.~\ref{thm:Countable_iff_exists_inj_to_N},
        if there is an injective function
        $f:S\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$, then $S$ is
        countable. Therefore, etc.
    \end{proof}
    \begin{theorem}
        If $X$ is infinite, then there exists a
        countably infinite set $A\subseteq{X}$.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        If $A$ is finite, then we are done. Suppose not.
        For $n\in\mathbb{N}$, let:
        \begin{equation}
            A_{n}
            =\{g:\mathbb{Z}_{n}\rightarrow{A}:f\textrm{ is inective}\}
        \end{equation}
        Also, define:
        \begin{equation}
            \mathcal{F}=\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb{N}}A_{n}
        \end{equation}
        But by the axiom of choice, there is a function
        $f:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathcal{F}$ such that
        $f_{n}\in{A}_{n}$. But then, for all
        $n\in\mathbb{N}$, the range of $f_{n}$ is finite.
        \begin{equation}
            A=\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb{N}}f_{n}
                \Big(\mathbb{Z}_{n}\Big)
        \end{equation}
        Then $A\subseteq{X}$ is countably infinite.
    \end{proof}
    The set of rational numbers, $\mathbb{Q}$, is also
    countable. We may intuitively think of $\mathbb{N}$
    as being smaller than $\mathbb{Q}$, since there are
    simple \textit{surjections} that can be constructed
    from $\mathbb{Q}$ to $\mathbb{N}$. There is also a
    surjection from $\mathbb{N}$ onto $\mathbb{Q}^{+}$,
    as is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Bijection_N_and_Q_Plus}.
    To construct such a surjection, write out all of the
    positive rational numbers in a grid so that $a_{nm}$
    is the number $n/m$. Then zig-zag along the diagonals
    to construct the function. Thus there is a surjection
    $f:\mathbb{Q}^{+}\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$ and a surjection
    $g:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{Q}^{+}$. The
    Cantor-Schr\"{o}eder-Bernstein theorem says that if there is
    surjection from $A$ to $B$ and a surjection from $B$ to $A$, then
    there is a bijection between $A$ and $B$. Therefore there is a
    bijection between $\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{Q}^{+}$, and
    $\mathbb{Q}^{+}$ is countable.

    We can modify Fig.~\ref{fig:Bijection_N_and_Q_Plus}
    slightly to create a surjection between $\mathbb{N}$
    and $\mathbb{Q}$, see
    Fig.~\ref{fig:Bijection_N_and_Q}.
    It is important to note that this bijection will not
    preserve the order of the rational numbers. The
    bijection will have to jump around back and forth.
    Any such bijection will be forced to do this, as the
    rationals are everywhere dense on $\mathbb{R}$. Any
    monotonic sequence of $\mathbb{Q}$ cannot possibly
    be a bijection.
    \begin{theorem}
        If $A$ is a countably infinite set and
        $B\subseteq{A}$, then $B$ is countable.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        As $A$ is countably infinite, there is a bijection
        $a:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow{A}$. Define:
        \begin{equation}
            K=\{n\in\mathbb{N}:a_{n}\in{B}\}
        \end{equation}
        As $B\subseteq{A}$,
        this set contains a subsequence of points in
        $\mathbb{N}$ that get mapped into $B$. If $K$ is finite,
        then $B$ is finite, and if not then $K$ is countably
        infinite, and thus $B$ is countably infinite.

    \begin{theorem}
        If $A$ is an infinite set, then there exists a
        countable subset $B\subseteq{A}$.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        If $A$ is infinite then there is an
        $a_{1}\in{A}$. But, as $A$ is infinite,
        $A\setminus\{a_{1}\}$ is infinite, and there
        is an $a_{2}\in{A}\setminus\{a_{1}\}$. Continuing
        we obtain a sequence of distinct elements in $A$.
        Let $B=\{a_{n}:n\in\mathbb{N}\}$. Then
        $B\subseteq{A}$, and $B$ is countable.
    \end{proof}
    \begin{lexample}
        Suppose we have a collection of disjoint intervals
        of $\mathbb{R}$. This collection is either finite
        or countable. For in every interval, choose a
        rational number $q_{n}$. Let
        $A=\{q_{1},q_{2},\hdots\}$. Then
        $A\subseteq\mathbb{Q}$, and thus $A$ is either
        finite or countable. But this is also an enumeration
        of the intervals in the collection, and thus the
        collection is either finite or countable.
    \end{lexample}
    Given a countable collection of sets
    $A=\{\mathcal{A}_{1},\mathcal{A}_{2},\hdots\}$ such
    that, for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$, $\mathcal{A}_{n}$ is
    also a countable set, then the union is countable. That is:
    \begin{equation}
        B=\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}\mathcal{A}_{n}
    \end{equation}
    is a countable set. The proof of this is a mimicry of
    the proof of the countability of $\mathbb{Q}$. Not
    every set is either finite or countable. The real numbers,
    $\mathbb{R}$, is an example of an \textit{uncountable}
    set. First, some notes on the power set of a set.
    \begin{figure}[H]

    \end{figure}
    The power set of any set is strictly larger than the
    original set. If $\Omega$ is finite with $n$ elements, it
    can be shown that $\mathcal{P}(\Omega)$ has $2^{n}$
    eleents. For infinite sets, there is a trivial surjection
    from $\mathcal{P}(\Omega)$ onto $\Omega$: for any element
    $x$, let $f(\{x\})=x$. This shows that
    $\Card(\Omega)\leq\Card(\mathcal{P}(\Omega))$. We now show
    that the inequality is strict.
    \begin{theorem}
        If $\Omega$ is a set, then there is no bijection
        $f:\Omega\rightarrow\mathcal{P}(\Omega)$
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        For suppose not, and let
        $f:\Omega\rightarrow\mathcal{P}(\Omega)$ be such a
        bijection. Define:
        \begin{equation}
            A=\{x\in\Omega:x\in{f}(x)\}
        \end{equation}
        Then $A\subseteq\Omega$, and thus
        $A\in\mathcal{P}(\Omega)$. But then the complement of
        $A$ is also an element of $\mathcal{P}(\Omega)$. But
        $f$ is a bijection and thus there is an $x\in\Omega$
        such that $f(x)=A^{C}$. If $x\in{f}(x)$, then
        $x\in{A}$, a contradiction as $f(x)=A^{C}$, and thus
        $x\in{A}^{C}$ as well. Therefore $x\notin{f}(x)$. But
        then $x\in{A}^{C}$. But, from the definition of $A$,
        since $x\in{A}^{C}$ and $f(x)=A^{C}$, $x\in{f}(x)$
        and thus $x\in{A}$, a contradiction. Thus there is no
        $x$ such that $f(x)=A^{C}$. Therefore, $f$ is not a
        bijection.
    \end{proof}
    From this we conclude that $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$
    is an uncountable infinite set. But since $\mathbb{R}$
    and $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$ have the same cardinality,
    $\mathbb{R}$ is also uncountable.
    If a set $A$ has the same cardinality as $\mathbb{R}$,
    we say that $A$ has the cardinality of the continuum.
    \begin{lexample}
        There is a bijection between the open unit
        square $(0,1)\times(0,1)$ and the open unit interval
        $(0,1)$. For an element $(x,y)\in(0,1)\times(0,1)$,
        let $z\in(0,1)$ be defined as
        $z=0.x_{1}y_{1}x_{2}y_{2}x_{3}y_{3}\dots$ This is
        a bijection, for all $(x,y)$ in the square there is
        a corresponding $z\in(0,1)$, and for all
        $z\in(0,1)$ there is a corresponding element of
        $(0,1)\times(0,1)$. We can say that $(x,y)$ can
        be coded into $z$, and $z$ can be decoded into
        $(x,y)$. Hence, $(0,1)\times(0,1)$ has the cardinality
        of the continuum. By stereographic projection and induction
        we obtain:

    \begin{lexample}
        Consider the set of all real-valued sequences. We've seen
        that any real number can be represented as a function
        $f:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\{0,1\}$. A real-valued sequence
        is a function $a:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$, and
        thus the set of real-valued sequences can be seen as the
        set of functions whose domain is $\mathbb{N}$ and whose
        range is the set of all functions
        $f:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\{0,1\}$. So given a sequence
        $a$, the image of $a_{n}$, for $n\in\mathbb{N}$, is a
        function $f_{n}:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\{0,1\}$. Therefore
        the set of all real-valued sequences can be represented
        as the set of all functions
        $g:\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\{0,1\}$, where
        $g(n,m)=f_{n}(m)$. But $\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}$ is
        countable, and thus the set of all functions of the form
        $g:\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\{0,1\}$ has the
        same cardinality as the set of all functions of the form
        $f:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\{0,1\}$. But this has the
        cardinality of the continuum. Therefore, the set of all
        real-valued sequences has the cardinality of the continuum.

    \begin{theorem}
        If $A$ is an infinite set, then there exists $S\subseteq{A}$ such that
        $S$ is countable.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        For as $A$ is infinite, for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$
        there exists a set $B\subseteq{A}$ such that
        $|B|=n$. For all $n\in\mathbb{N}$,
        define the following:
        \begin{equation}
            \mathcal{S}_{n}=\{B\subseteq{A}:|B|=n\}
        \end{equation}
        Let $\mathcal{S}$ be defined as:
        \begin{equation}
            \mathcal{S}=\{\mathcal{S}_{n}:n\in\mathbb{N}\}
        \end{equation}
        Then $\mathcal{S}$ is countable, for
        $a:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathcal{S}$ defined
        by $a_{n}=\mathcal{S}_{n}$ is a bijection.
        By the axiom of choice, there is a function:
        \begin{equation}
            \alpha:\mathcal{S}\rightarrow
            \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}\mathcal{S}_{n}
        \end{equation}
        Such that, for all $x\in\mathcal{S}$,
        $\alpha(x)\in{x}$. But then, for all
        $x\in\mathcal{S}$, $\alpha(x)$ is a subset
        of $A$. But for all $x\in\mathcal{S}$, there
        is an $n\in\mathbb{N}$ such that
        $a_{n}=x$. Thus, let $S$ be the following:
        \begin{equation}
            S=\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}\alpha(a_{n})
        \end{equation}
    \end{proof}

    Using the \textit{diagonal argument},
    we obtain:
    In the absence of the requirement that
    $a\cap{b}=\emptyset$ for all pairs in $\mathcal{U}$,
    we still have that the union is, at most, countable.
    The mapping we found would be a
    \textit{surjection}, rather than a bijection.
    The union is then either finite or countable. The
    Cantor-Schr\"{o}der-Bernstein Theorem can often be
    used to help identify the size of a set. This says
    that if $A$ and $B$ are sets such that there exists
    a surjective function $f:A\rightarrow{B}$ and a
    surjective function $g:B\rightarrow{A}$, then there
    is a bijective function $h:A\rightarrow{B}$. The
    requirement that $f$ and $g$ both be surjective
    can be replaced with the requirement that they both
    be injective. This is similar to saying that if
    $\Card(A)\leq\Card(B)$ and $\Card(B)\leq\Card(A)$,
    then $\Card(A)=\Card(B)$. Here, $\Card(A)$ denotes
    the \textit{cardinality} of the set $A$.
    \begin{theorem}
        Equivalence has the following properties:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item   $A\sim A$ for any set $A$.
            \item   If $A\sim B$, then $B\sim A$.
            \item   If $A\sim B$ and $B\sim C$, then $A\sim C$.

    \begin{proof}
    In order,
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item   For let $f$ be the identity mapping. That is, for all
            $x\in A$, $f(x)=x$. This is bijective and thus $A\sim A$.
    \item   If $A\sim B$, there is a bijective function $f:A\rightarrow B$.
            Then $f^{-1}:B\rightarrow A$ is bijective, and $B\sim A$.
    \item   Let $f:A\rightarrow B$ and $g:B\rightarrow C$ be bijections.
            Then $g\circ f:A\rightarrow C$ is a bijection,
            and thus $A\sim C$.
    \end{enumerate}
    \end{proof}
    \begin{theorem}
        If $A\sim{C}$ and $B\sim{D}$, where $A,B$ and $C,D$ are disjoint,
        then $A\cup{B}\sim{C}\cup{D}$.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        Let $f:A\rightarrow C$ and $g:B\rightarrow D$ be isomorphisms.
        Let $h:A\cup{B}\rightarrow{C}\cup{D}$ be defined by:
        \begin{equation}
            h(x)=
            \begin{cases}
                f(x),&x\in{A}\\
                g(x),&x\in{B}
            \end{cases}
        \end{equation}
        As $A$ and $B$ are disjoint, this is indeed a function and it is
        bijective as $C$ and $D$ are disjoint. Therefore, etc.

    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
    Suppose not. Let $A$ be an infinite set and suppose there is an $n\in \mathbb{N}$ such
    that $A\sim \mathbb{Z}_n$. But as $A$ is an infinite set, there is a proper subset $B$
    such that $B\sim A$. But then $B\sim \mathbb{Z}_n$. But as $B$ is a proper subset,
    there is at least one point in $A$ not contained in $B$. But then $|B|<n$, a contradiction. Thus $A$ is not finite.
    \end{proof}
    \begin{theorem}
        If $A$ is an infinite set, then for every $n\in \mathbb{N}$
        there is a subset $B\subset A$ such that $B\sim \mathbb{Z}_n$.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
    Suppose not. Then there is a least $n\in \mathbb{N}:B\subset A\Rightarrow |B|<n$.
    But then $A$ has at most $n$ elements, a contradiction.

    \begin{theorem}
    A set $A$ is infinite if and only if it contains a proper subset $B$ such that $B\sim \mathbb{N}$.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
    If $A$ has a proper subset $B$ such that $B\sim \mathbb{N}$, then $A$ is not finite and is thus infinite.
    If $A$ is infinite, then for all $n\in \mathbb{N}$ there is a set $A_n\subset A$ such that
    $A_n \sim \mathbb{Z}_n$. Let $B = \{a_n: a_n \in A_n, a_n \notin A_{n-1}\}$.
    Note that $a_{n} = a_{m}$ if and only if $m= n$. Let $f:\mathbb{N} \rightarrow B$
    be defined by $n\mapsto a_n$. This is bijective, and thus $B\sim \mathbb{N}$.
    \end{proof}
    This shows that $\mathbb{N}$ is, in a sense, the "Smallest,"
    infinite set. $|\mathbb{N}|$ is denoted $\aleph_0$.

        If $B\subset A$, $f:A\rightarrow B$ is injective, then there
        is a bijection $g:A\rightarrow B$
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        Let $Y = A\setminus B$, and inductively define
        $f^{k+1}(Y)=f(f^{k}(Y))$. Let
        $X=Y\cup(\cup_{k=0}^{\infty}f^{k}(Y))$. As  $Y\cap{B}=\emptyset$,
        then $f(Y)\cap Y= \emptyset$. As $f$ is an injection,
        $f(f(Y))\cap f(Y)=\emptyset$,
        and similarly $f(f(Y))\cap Y = \emptyset$. Inductively,
        $f^{n}(Y)\cap f^{m}(Y)=\emptyset$,
    for $n\ne m$. It then also follows that $f(X) = \cup_{k=1}^{\infty} f^{k}(Y)$.
    Thus $A\setminus X = [B\cup Y]\setminus [Y\cup f(X)] = B\setminus f(X)$.
    Let $g(x) = \begin{cases} f(x), & x\in X \\ x, & x \in B\setminus f(X)\end{cases}$.
    This is a bijections from $A$ to $B$.
    \end{proof}

    If $A_1 \subset A$, $B_1 \subset B$, and $A\sim B_1$, $B \sim A_1$, then $A\sim B$.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
    Let $f:A\rightarrow B_1$ and $g:B\rightarrow A_1$ be bijections.
    Then $(g\circ f):A\rightarrow A_1$ is an injection from $A$ into $A_1$.
    Thus, there is a bijection $h:A\rightarrow A_1$. Thus, $A\sim A_1 \sim B\Rightarrow A\sim B$.

    \begin{theorem}
        $\mathbb{N}\times \mathbb{N}$ is countable.

    \begin{proof}
    For $f:\mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}\times \mathbb{N}$ defined by $f(n) = (0,n)$
    shows there is a subset $N_1$ of $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ such that
    $\mathbb{N}\sim N_1$. And $g:\mathbb{N}\times \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$
    defined by $g(n,m) =n+2^{n+m}$ shows that there is a subset $M_1 \subset \mathbb{N}$
    such that $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \sim M_1$. By the Cantor-Schr\"{o}der-Bernstein Theorem,
    $\mathbb{N} \sim \mathbb{N}\times \mathbb{N}$.

        If $A$ is infinite and $f:A\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$ is injective,
        then $A$ is countable.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
    As $A$ is infinite and $A\sim f(A)$, $f(A)$ is infinite.
    But as $f(A)\subset \mathbb{N}$ and $f(A)$ is infinite,
    $f(A)\sim \mathbb{N}$. Thus, $A\sim \mathbb{N}$.
    \end{proof}
    \begin{definition}
        If $A$ and $B$ are sets, we say that $|A|<|B|$ if there is an

    For let $M$ be a set with cardinality $|M|$. Let $U_m \subset M$ such that $U_m \sim M$.
    Such a set exists, for example, the singletons of $\mathcal{P}(M)$. Thus, $M$ is split into
    two distinct sets $Class\ I=\{x\in M: \textrm{There is a subset } X\subset U_m\textrm{ such that }x\in X\}$,
    and $Class\ II=M-Class\ I$. Let $L = Class\ II$. $L\subset M$, and thus $L\in \mathcal{P}(M)$. However,
    $L \notin U_m$ for if it were, then the element $m_1$ paired with it in $M$ is of Class II
    (For it cannot be of Class I as $m_1$ would not appear in $L$). If $m_1$ were in Class II,
    then by definition $m_1 \notin L$. But as $m_1 \in L$, we see that $L\notin U_m$. Thus,
    $|U_m| <|\mathcal{P}(M)|$, and therefore $|M|<|\mathcal{P}(M)|$.
    \end{proof}
    \begin{theorem}
        The set $R=\{x\in \mathbb{R}:0<x<1\}$ is equivalent to
        $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        For every real number has a binary representation (Proof of this
        is omitted). That is, for every real number $r$, there is a sequence
        $a:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\{0,\,1\}$ such that:
        \begin{equation}
            r=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{a_{n}}{2^{n}}
        \end{equation}
    As $0<x<1$, this sum is just $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{a_n}{2^n}$.
    Let $f:\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})\rightarrow R$ be defined by the
    following: If $N\subset \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$ and $n\in N$, then
    $a_{n}=1$, other wise $n=0$. Then every real number is matched to a
    subset of $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$, moreover this is done bijectively.
    Thus, $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})\sim R$.
    \end{proof}
    \begin{theorem}
        $\mathbb{R}\sim\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        It suffices to show that $(0,1)\sim\mathbb{R}$.
        Let $f:(0,1)\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ be defined by:
        \begin{equation}
            f(x)=
            \begin{cases}
                \frac{x(1-x)}{2x-1},&x\ne\frac{1}{2}\\
                0,&x=\frac{1}{2}
            \end{cases}
        \end{equation}
    \end{proof}
