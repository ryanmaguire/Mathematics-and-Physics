\chapter{Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory}
    We'll start from the basics and develop mathematics from an axiomatic
    standpoint, adopting as truths the few postulates of Zermelo and
    Fraenkel. We'll then add the axiom of choice to our toolbelt and
    proceed from there to define and prove many of the basic and familiar
    results and concepts of mathematics. It is important not to take anything
    for granted even if something seems obvious. The existence of many types
    of sets will be proved from ZFC, rather than simply accepting these
    things as trivial truths.
