\section{Groups}
    While monoids are structurally simpler than groups, the notion of a group is
    one of the most basic and fundamental algebraic structures that one can
    consider.
    \begin{fdefinition}{Group}{Group}
        A group is a \gls{monoid} $(G,*)$ such that for all $g\in{G}$, $g$ is an
        \gls{invertible element} with respect to $*$. That is:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The binary operation $*$ is associative.
            \item There exists an identity element $e\in{G}$.
            \item For every element $a\in{A}$, there is an inverse element.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{fdefinition}
    Note that it is not necessarily true that $a*b=b*a$. Such groups are called
    Abelian. There are several examples of groups that one is likely familiar
    with.
    \begin{example}
        If $+$ denotes the usual addition on $\mathbb{Z}$, then
        $(\mathbb{Z},+)$ is a group. The unital element is 0, and for all
        $n\in\mathbb{Z}$, $\minus{n}$ is an inverse element of $n$. That is,
        $n+(\minus{n})=0$, which is a unital element. Moreover, addition is
        associative and therefore $(\mathbb{Z},+)$ is a group.
    \end{example}
    \begin{example}
        If $\mathbb{R}^{+}$ denotes the positive real numbers, and if $\cdot$
        denotes the usual multiplication of real numbers, then
        $(\mathbb{R},\cdot)$ is a group. For this group, 1 is the unital element
        for all $r\in\mathbb{R}^{+}$, $1/r$ is the inverse element. Lastly,
        the operation is indeed associative.
    \end{example}
    \begin{example}
        Consider $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ with modular addition $+$. Then
        $(\mathbb{Z}_{n},+)$ is a group. The unital element is $0$ since for all
        $k\in\mathbb{Z}_{n}$, $k+0=k$. The inverse of $k\in\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ is
        the unique integer $m\in\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ such that $k+m=n$. That is,
        $m=n-k$. For then $k+m=n$, and $n$ is equivalent to zero in
        $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$. Since modular addition is commutative, it follows that
        $0$ is a left and right unital element and that each element is left and
        right invertible, and thus $(\mathbb{Z}_{n},+)$ is a group.
    \end{example}
    \begin{example}
        Consider $\mathbb{Z}_{4}$ with it's modular addition $+$. Then
        $(\mathbb{Z}_{4},+)$ is a group. We can represent the operation $+$ with
        the following table:
        \begin{table}[H]
            \centering
            \captionsetup{type=table}
            \begin{tabular}{c|cccc}
                $+$&0&1&2&3\\
                \hline
                0&0&1&2&3\\
                1&1&2&3&0\\
                2&2&3&0&1\\
                3&3&0&1&2
            \end{tabular}
            \caption{The Group Structure of $\mathbb{Z}_{4}$}

    \end{example}
    \begin{theorem}
        If $G$ is a set, if $*$ is an associative binary operation on $G$, if
        $e\in{G}$ is a unique right unital element, and if for all $g\in{G}$ it
        is true that $g$ is weakly right invertible, then $G$ is a group.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        For by
        Thm.~\ref{thm:existence_of_weak_left_and_weak_right_implies_unital},
        $e$ is a unital element. And by
        Thm.~\ref{thm:unqiue_right_unit_and_weak_r_inv_implies_inv}, for all
        $g\in{G}$ it is true that $g$ is invertible. Therefore, $(G,*)$ is a
        group (Def.~\ref{def:Group}).
    \end{proof}
    Thus it suffices to check that there is a unique right identity and that all
    elements are weakly right intertible. The unital element of a group is
    unique (Thm.~\ref{thm:Unital_Elements_are_Unique}), as are the inverses of
    elements (Thm.~\ref{thm:Assoc_Op_Inverses_are_Unique}). Moreover, the
    inverse of a unital element is itself
    (Thm.~\ref{thm:Unital_Elements_Are_Invertible}).
    \begin{theorem}
        \label{thm:Group_Inverse_of_Product}%
        If $(G,*)$ is a group and $a,b\in G$, then:
        \begin{equation}
            (a*b)^{\minus{1}}=b^{\minus{1}}*a^{\minus{1}}
        \end{equation}
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        For if $(G,*)$ is a group, and if $a,b\in{G}$, then $*$ is associative
        and $a$ and $b$ are invertible (Def.~\ref{def:Group}). But then by
        Thm.~\ref{thm:assoc_op_prod_of_inv_is_inv},
        $a*b=b^{\minus{1}}*a^{\minus{1}}$.
    \end{proof}
    \begin{theorem}
        If $(G,*)$ is a group and $a\in{G}$, then:
        \begin{equation}
            (a^{\minus{1}})^{\minus{1}}=a
        \end{equation}
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        For if $e$ is the unital element of $G$, then:
        \begin{align}
            a^{\minus{1}}*(a^{\minus{1}})^{\minus{1}}
            &=(a^{\minus{1}}* a)^{\minus{1}}
            \tag{Thm.~\ref{thm:Group_Inverse_of_Product}}\\
            &=e
            \tag{Inverse Property}
        \end{align}
        From uniqueness, $(a^{\minus{1}})^{\minus{1}}=a$.
    \end{proof}
    \begin{fdefinition}{Abelian Group}{Abelian_Group}
        An \gls{Abelian group} is a \gls{group} $(G,*)$ such that $*$ is
        a \gls{commutative operation}.
    \end{fdefinition}
    \begin{lexample}
        Not every group is Abelian, and a classic non-Abelian group is the group
        of symmetries on an equilateral triangle.
    \end{lexample}
    \begin{definition}
        If $(G,*)$ and $(G',\circ)$ are groups and
        $f:G\rightarrow G'$ is a bijective function, then $f$ is said to
        be an isomorphism between $(G,*)$ and $(G',\circ)$ if and only if
        for all $a,b\in{G}$, $f(a*b)=f(a)\circ{f}(b)$.
    \end{definition}
    \begin{theorem}
        If $(G,*)$ and $(G',\circ)$ are isomorphic with identities $e_{*}$
        and $e_{\circ}$ are the identities, then $f(e_{*})=e_{\circ}$.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        $\forall a\in G,\ f(a)=f(a* e_*) = f(a)\circ f(e_*)$ as $f$ is
        an isomorphism. As identities are unique, $f(e_*)=e_{\circ}$.
    \end{proof}
    \begin{theorem}
        If $(G,*)$ and $(G',\circ)$ are isomorphic, with isomorphism $f$, and if
        $a\in{G}$, then $f(a^{\minus{1}})=f(a)^{\minus{1}}$.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        For:
        \begin{equation}
            e_{\circ}=f(e_*)
                     =f(a*a^{-1})
                     =f(a^{-1}*a)
                     =f(a)\circ f(a^{-1})
                     =f(a^{-1})\circ f(a)
        \end{equation}
        As inverses are unique, $f(a^{-1})=f(a)^{-1}$.
    \end{proof}
    \begin{example}
        $G=\{1\}$ is an Abelian group under multiplication.
        This is the trivial group.
    \end{example}
    \begin{theorem}
        If $(G,*)$ is a group, then the following are true:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item If $a*b=a*c$, then $b=c$.
            \item If $b*a=c*a$, then $b=c$.
            \item $\forall_{{a,b}\in{G}}\exists_{{x}\in{G}}:a*x=b$
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{definition}
        The order of a group is number of elements in the
        group.
    \end{definition}
    \begin{definition}
        The direct product of two groups $(G,*)$ and
        $(H,\circ)$ is the group  $({G}\times{H},\star)$
        where $\star$ is the binary operation defined by
        $(g_{1},h_{1})\star(g_{2},h_{2})%
         =(g_{1}*g_{2},{h_{1}}\circ{h_{2}})$
    \end{definition}
    \begin{definition}
        A permutation group on $n$ elements is a
        group whose elements are permutations of
        $n$ elements.
    \end{definition}
    \begin{definition}
        The symmetric group on $n$ elements,
        denoted $S_{n}$, is the group formed by
        permuting $n$ elements.
    \end{definition}
    \begin{definition}
        A homomorphism from a group $(G,*)$ to
        a group $(H,\circ)$ is a function
        $h:{G}\rightarrow{H}$ such that for all
        ${a,b}\in{G}$, $h(a*b)={h(a)}\circ{h(b)}$
    \end{definition}
    \begin{definition}
        An epimorphism from a group $(G,*)$ to

        $h:{G}\rightarrow{H}$ such that
        $h$ is surjective.

    \end{definition}
    \begin{definition}
        An isomorphism from a group $(G,*)$ to
        a group $(H,\circ)$ is a homomorphism
        $h:{G}\rightarrow{H}$ such that

    \end{definition}
    \begin{definition}
        A ring is a set $R$ and two binary operations
        on $R$, denoted $(R,\cdot,+)$, such that:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item $(R,+)$ is an Abelian group.
            \item $a\cdot({b}\cdot{c})=({a}\cdot{b})\cdot{c}$
            \item ${a}\cdot(b+c)={a}\cdot{b}+{a}\cdot{c}$

        such that there is a ${1}\in{R}$ such that for
        all ${a}\in{R}$, ${a}\cdot{1}={1}\cdot{a}=a$.
    \end{definition}
    Left and right identities are elements such that ${e_{L}}\cdot{a}=a$
    and ${e_{R}}\cdot{a}=a$. If inverses $a_{L}^{-1}$ and $a_{R}^{-1}$
    exist for $a$, then $a_{L}^{-1}=a_{R}^{-1}$. That is, the inverse
    is the same for both right and left identities.
