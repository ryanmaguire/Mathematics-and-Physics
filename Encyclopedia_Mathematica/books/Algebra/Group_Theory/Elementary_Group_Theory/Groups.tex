\section{Groups}
    While monoids are structurally simpler than groups, the notion of a group is
    one of the most basic and fundamental algebraic structures that one can
    consider.
    \begin{fdefinition}{Group}{Group}
        A group is a \gls{monoid} $(G,*)$ such that for all $g\in{G}$, $g$ is an
        \gls{invertible element} with respect to $*$. That is:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The binary operation $*$ is associative.
            \item There exists an identity element $e\in{G}$.
            \item For every element $a\in{A}$, there is an inverse element.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{fdefinition}
    Note that it is not necessarily true that $a*b=b*a$. Such groups are called
    Abelian. There are several examples of groups that one is likely familiar
    with.
    \begin{example}
        If $+$ denotes the usual addition on $\mathbb{Z}$, then
        $(\mathbb{Z},+)$ is a group. The unital element is 0, and for all
        $n\in\mathbb{Z}$, $\minus{n}$ is an inverse element of $n$. That is,
        $n+(\minus{n})=0$, which is a unital element. Moreover, addition is
        associative and therefore $(\mathbb{Z},+)$ is a group.
    \end{example}
    \begin{example}
        If $\mathbb{R}^{+}$ denotes the positive real numbers, and if $\cdot$
        denotes the usual multiplication of real numbers, then
        $(\mathbb{R},\cdot)$ is a group. For this group, 1 is the unital element
        for all $r\in\mathbb{R}^{+}$, $1/r$ is the inverse element. Lastly,
        the operation is indeed associative.
    \end{example}
    For $(G,*)$ to be a group it suffices to check that there is a right
    identity and that all elements are weakly right intertible.

    We've seen that a unital element of a binary operation is unique
    (Thm.~\ref{thm:Unital_Elements_are_Unique}) and that for any associative
    operation $*$, invertible element have unique inverses
    (Thm.~\ref{thm:Assoc_Op_Inverses_are_Unique}), and as such these results
    apply to groups. Similarly we've seen that unital elements are invertible
    and that they are their own inverses. One thing we've yet to prove is how to
    compute the inverse of a product.
    \begin{theorem}
        \label{thm:Group_Inverse_of_Product}%
        If $(G,*)$ is a group and $a,b\in G$, then:
        \begin{equation}
            (a*b)^{\minus{1}}=b^{\minus{1}}*a^{\minus{1}}
        \end{equation}
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        For:
        \begin{align}
            (a*b)*(b^{\minus{1}}*a^{\minus{1}})
                &=a*(b*b^{\minus{1}})*a^{\minus{1}}
            \tag{Associativity}\\
            &=a*(e)*a^{\minus{1}}
            \tag{Inverse}\\
            &=a*a^{\minus{1}}
            \tag{Identity}\\
            &=e
            \tag{Inverse}
        \end{align}
        Thus $b^{\minus{1}}*a^{\minus{1}}$ is a right-inverse of $a*b$. But
        since $(G,*)$ is a group, right-inverses are left-inverses, and
        therefore $b^{-1}*a^{-1}$ is an inverse of $a*b$. But inverses are
        unique (Thm.~\ref{thm:Assoc_Op_Inverses_are_Unique}). Thus,
        $(a*b)^{\minus{1}}=b^{\minus{1}}*a^{\minus{1}}$.
    \end{proof}
    \begin{theorem}
        If $(G,*)$ is a group and $a\in{G}$, then:
        \begin{equation}
            (a^{-1})^{-1}=a
        \end{equation}
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        For if $e$ is the unital element of $G$, then:
        \begin{align}
            a^{-1}*(a^{-1})^{-1}
            &=(a^{-1}* a)^{-1}
            \tag{Thm.~\ref{thm:Group_Theory_Inverse_of_Product}}\\
            &=e
            \tag{Inverse Property}
        \end{align}
        From uniqueness, $(a^{-1})^{-1}=a$.
    \end{proof}
    \begin{definition}
        If $(G,*)$ and $(G',\circ)$ are groups and
        $f:G\rightarrow G'$ is a bijective function, then $f$ is said to
        be an isomorphism between $(G,*)$ and $(G',\circ)$ if and only if
        for all $a,b\in{G}$, $f(a*b)=f(a)\circ{f}(b)$.
    \end{definition}
    \begin{theorem}
        If $(G,*)$ and $(G',\circ)$ are isomorphic with identities $e_{*}$
        and $e_{\circ}$ are the identities, then $f(e_{*})=e_{\circ}$.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        $\forall a\in G,\ f(a)=f(a* e_*) = f(a)\circ f(e_*)$ as $f$ is
        an isomorphism. As identities are unique, $f(e_*)=e_{\circ}$.
    \end{proof}
    \begin{theorem}
        If $(G,*)$ and $(G',\circ)$ are isomorphic, with isomorphism $f$, and if
        $a\in{G}$, then $f(a^{\minus{1}})=f(a)^{\minus{1}}$.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        For:
        \begin{equation}
            e_{\circ}=f(e_*)
                     =f(a*a^{-1})
                     =f(a^{-1}*a)
                     =f(a)\circ f(a^{-1})
                     =f(a^{-1})\circ f(a)
        \end{equation}
        As inverses are unique, $f(a^{-1})=f(a)^{-1}$.
    \end{proof}
    \begin{definition}
    A binary operation $*$ on a set $A$ is said to be commutative if and only for all $a,b\in A$, $a*b = b*a$.

            \item If $a*b=a*c$, then $b=c$.
            \item If $b*a=c*a$, then $b=c$.
            \item $\forall_{{a,b}\in{G}}\exists_{{x}\in{G}}:a*x=b$

        The direct product of two groups $(G,*)$ and
        $(H,\circ)$ is the group  $({G}\times{H},\star)$
        where $\star$ is the binary operation defined by
        $(g_{1},h_{1})\star(g_{2},h_{2})%
         =(g_{1}*g_{2},{h_{1}}\circ{h_{2}})$
    \end{definition}
    \begin{definition}
        A permutation group on $n$ elements is a

    \end{definition}
    \begin{definition}
        The symmetric group on $n$ elements,
        denoted $S_{n}$, is the group formed by

    \end{definition}
    \begin{definition}
        A homomorphism from a group $(G,*)$ to
        a group $(H,\circ)$ is a function
        $h:{G}\rightarrow{H}$ such that for all
        ${a,b}\in{G}$, $h(a*b)={h(a)}\circ{h(b)}$
    \end{definition}
    \begin{definition}

    \begin{definition}
        A ring is a set $R$ and two binary operations
        on $R$, denoted $(R,\cdot,+)$, such that:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item $(R,+)$ is an Abelian group.
            \item $a\cdot({b}\cdot{c})=({a}\cdot{b})\cdot{c}$
            \item ${a}\cdot(b+c)={a}\cdot{b}+{a}\cdot{c}$

    \end{definition}
    Left and right identities are elements such that ${e_{L}}\cdot{a}=a$
    and ${e_{R}}\cdot{a}=a$. If inverses $a_{L}^{-1}$ and $a_{R}^{-1}$
    exist for $a$, then $a_{L}^{-1}=a_{R}^{-1}$. That is, the inverse
    is the same for both right and left identities.
