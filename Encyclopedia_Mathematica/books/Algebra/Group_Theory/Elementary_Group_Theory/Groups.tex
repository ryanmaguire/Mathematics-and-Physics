\section{Groups}
    While monoids are structurally simpler than groups, the notion of a group is
    one of the most basic and fundamental algebraic structures that one can
    consider.
    \begin{fdefinition}{Group}{Group}
        A group is a \gls{monoid} $(G,*)$ such that for all $g\in{G}$, $g$ is an
        \gls{invertible element} with respect to $*$. That is:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The binary operation $*$ is associative.
            \item There exists an identity element $e\in{G}$.
            \item For every element $a\in{A}$, there is an inverse element.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{fdefinition}
    Note that it is not necessarily true that $a*b=b*a$. Such groups are called
    Abelian. There are several examples of groups that one is likely familiar
    with.
    \begin{example}
        If $+$ denotes the usual addition on $\mathbb{Z}$, then
        $(\mathbb{Z},+)$ is a group. The unital element is 0, and for all
        $n\in\mathbb{Z}$, $\minus{n}$ is an inverse element of $n$. That is,
        $n+(\minus{n})=0$, which is a unital element. Moreover, addition is
        associative and therefore $(\mathbb{Z},+)$ is a group.
    \end{example}
    \begin{example}
        If $\mathbb{R}^{+}$ denotes the positive real numbers, and if $\cdot$
        denotes the usual multiplication of real numbers, then
        $(\mathbb{R},\cdot)$ is a group. For this group, 1 is the unital element
        for all $r\in\mathbb{R}^{+}$, $1/r$ is the inverse element. Lastly,
        the operation is indeed associative.
    \end{example}
    \begin{example}
        Consider $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ with modular addition $+$. Then
        $(\mathbb{Z}_{n},+)$ is a group. The unital element is $0$ since for all
        $k\in\mathbb{Z}_{n}$, $k+0=k$. The inverse of $k\in\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ is
        the unique integer $m\in\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ such that $k+m=n$. That is,
        $m=n-k$. For then $k+m=n$, and $n$ is equivalent to zero in
        $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$. Since modular addition is commutative, it follows that
        $0$ is a left and right unital element and that each element is left and
        right invertible, and thus $(\mathbb{Z}_{n},+)$ is a group.
    \end{example}
    \begin{example}
        Consider $\mathbb{Z}_{4}$ with it's modular addition $+$. Then
        $(\mathbb{Z}_{4},+)$ is a group. We can represent the operation $+$ with
        the following table:
        \begin{table}[H]

    \begin{theorem}
        If $G$ is a set, if $*$ is an associative binary operation on $G$, if
        $e\in{G}$ is a unique right unital element, and if for all $g\in{G}$ it
        is true that $g$ is weakly right invertible, then $G$ is a group.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        For by
        Thm.~\ref{thm:existence_of_weak_left_and_weak_right_implies_unital},
        $e$ is a unital element. And by
        Thm.~\ref{thm:unqiue_right_unit_and_weak_r_inv_implies_inv}, for all
        $g\in{G}$ it is true that $g$ is invertible. Therefore, $(G,*)$ is a
        group (Def.~\ref{def:Group}).
    \end{proof}
    Thus it suffices to check that there is a unique right identity and that all
    elements are weakly right intertible. The unital element of a group is
    unique (Thm.~\ref{thm:Unital_Elements_are_Unique}), as are the inverses of
    elements (Thm.~\ref{thm:Assoc_Op_Inverses_are_Unique}). Moreover, the
    inverse of a unital element is itself
    (Thm.~\ref{thm:Unital_Elements_Are_Invertible}).
    \begin{theorem}
        \label{thm:Group_Inverse_of_Product}%
        If $(G,*)$ is a group and $a,b\in G$, then:
        \begin{equation}
            (a*b)^{\minus{1}}=b^{\minus{1}}*a^{\minus{1}}
        \end{equation}
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        For if $(G,*)$ is a group, and if $a,b\in{G}$, then $*$ is associative
        and $a$ and $b$ are invertible (Def.~\ref{def:Group}). But then by
        Thm.~\ref{thm:assoc_op_prod_of_inv_is_inv},
        $a*b=b^{\minus{1}}*a^{\minus{1}}$.
    \end{proof}
    \begin{theorem}
        If $(G,*)$ is a group and $a\in{G}$, then:
        \begin{equation}
            (a^{\minus{1}})^{\minus{1}}=a
        \end{equation}
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        For if $e$ is the unital element of $G$, then:
        \begin{align}
            a^{\minus{1}}*(a^{\minus{1}})^{\minus{1}}
            &=(a^{\minus{1}}* a)^{\minus{1}}
            \tag{Thm.~\ref{thm:Group_Inverse_of_Product}}\\
            &=e
            \tag{Inverse Property}
        \end{align}
        From uniqueness, $(a^{\minus{1}})^{\minus{1}}=a$.
    \end{proof}
    One of the fundamental aspects of elementary algebra is adding and
    subtracting like expressions from two sides of an equation. That is, if we
    are given $4x+1=9$, we solve this by adding $\minus{1}$ to both sides, and
    then dividing both sides by $4$ yielding $x=2$. Such procedure are valid
    because of the \textit{cancellation laws} of real number arithmetic. Such
    laws hold for groups, as well.
    \begin{ltheorem}{Left Cancellation Law}{Group_Left_Cancellation_Law}
        If $(G,*)$ is a group, if $a,b,c\in{G}$, and if $a*b=a*c$, then $b=c$.
    \end{ltheorem}

    \begin{fdefinition}{Abelian Group}{Abelian_Group}
        An \gls{Abelian group} is a \gls{group} $(G,*)$ such that $*$ is
        a \gls{commutative operation}.
    \end{fdefinition}
    \begin{lexample}{The Dihedral Group $D_{6}$}{Dihedral_Group_D_6}
        Not every group is Abelian, and a classic non-Abelian group is the group
        of symmetries on an equilateral triangle. This is the dihedral group
        $D_{6}$. It is formed by considering all of the distinct ways one can
        rearrange the three points on an equilateral triangle by means of
        rotation by $60^{\circ}$ and by reflection across the $y$ axis, as well
        as any combination of these two (see Fig.~\ref{fig:Dihedral_Group_D_6}).
        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \captionsetup{type=figure}
            \input{tikz/Dihedral_Group_D6_Diagram.tex}
            \caption{The Dihedral Group $D_{6}$}
            \label{fig:Dihedral_Group_D_6}
        \end{figure}
        It turns out there are 6 distinct such moves, but by considering $*$ to
        be the \textit{successor} operation, $(D_{6},*)$ forms a group. The
        successor operation means that if $r$ denotes rotation and $a$ denotes
        reflection, then $r*a$ denotes \textit{rotate and then reflect}. By
        studying the triangle we get the \textit{Cayley table}
        (Tab.~\ref{tab:Cayley_Table_D_6}) of this operation. A few things to
        note, the identity of our group is the \textit{do nothing} symmetry.
        That is, we neither rotate nor reflect. Also note that reflecting twice
        in a row or rotating three times in a row is equivalent to doing nothing.
        The last thing to note is that reflection, rotation, then reflecting
        again is the same as rotating \textit{backwards}. In other words, we
        have the following constraints:
        \begin{equation}
            r^{3}=e
            \quad\quad
            a^{2}=e
            \quad\quad
            (a*r)*(a*r)=e
        \end{equation}
        We can verify this last statement via pictures.
        Fig.~\ref{fig:Restraints_on_D_6} shows that $a*r*a*r$ is equivalent to
        doing nothing, as claimed.
        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \captionsetup{type=figure}
            \resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{%
                \input{tikz/Dihedral_Group_D6_Restraints.tex}
            }
            \caption{Restraints on the Dihedral Group $D_{6}$}
            \label{fig:Restraints_on_D_6}
        \end{figure}
        This tells us that rotation and reflection has an inverse notion
        (rotate backwards and reflect again, respectively). Since the group is
        determined by these two operations, we need only check that
        $r*(ar)=(r*a)*r$ and $a*(r*a)=(a*r)*a$ to determine the associative of
        the rest of the group. We can do this by examing the triangle
        (see Fig.~\ref{fig:Assoc_of_Dihedral_Group_D6}). That is, if we
        rotate, and the follow by reflecting and then rotating, it's the same
        thing as rotating and then reflecting, following by rotating again.
        Similarly, if we reflect, and then follow by rotating and then
        reflecting, this is equivalence to reflecting and then rotating, and
        then following with another reflection.
        \begin{figure}[H]

        With this we can compute the table.

                $a*r$&$a*r$&$a*r^{2}$&$a$&$r^{2}$&$e$&$r$\\
                $a*r^{2}$&$a*r^{2}$&$a$&$a*r$&$r$&$r^{2}$&$e$

            \caption{Cayley Table of $D_{6}$}
            \label{tab:Cayley_Table_D_6}
        \end{table}
        We now see that $(D_{6},*)$ is not an Abelian group since the successor
        operation is not commutative. That is, $r*a=a*r^{2}\ne{a}*r$, and thus
        $a*r\ne{r}*a$.
    \end{lexample}
    \begin{example}
        The trivial group is the set $G=\{\emptyset\}$, although we usually
        label $\emptyset=e$ when considering the trivial group, and we combine
        this with the operation $*:G\times{G}\rightarrow{G}$ defined by $e*e=e$.
        This makes $(G,*)$ a group, but moreover it is an Abelian group since
        $*$ is trivially commutative.
    \end{example}
    \begin{example}
        Addition in $\mathbb{Z}$ and multiplication in $\mathbb{Q}^{+}$ are
        commutative operations, and thus $(\mathbb{Z},+)$ and
        $(\mathbb{Q}^{+},\cdot\,)$ are Abelian groups.
    \end{example}
    \begin{example}
        Addition of complex numbers $\mathbb{C}$ is commutative and associative,
        as is the multiplication of non-zero complex numbers. Thus
        $(\mathbb{C},+)$ and $(\mathbb{C}\setminus\{0\},\cdot\,)$ are
        Abelian groups. The identities are $0=0+i0$ and $1=1+i0$, respectively.
        Recall that we developed the arithmetic of $\mathbb{C}$ based on the
        structure of $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ together with the arithmetic of
        $\mathbb{R}$. We define:
        \begin{equation}
            a+ib=(a,\,b)
            \quad\quad
            a,b\in\mathbb{R}
        \end{equation}
        And defined addition and multiplication as follows:
        \begin{subequations}
            \begin{align}
                (a+ib)+(c+id)&=(a+c)+i(b+d)\\
                (a+ib)\cdot(c+id)&=(ac-bd)+i(bc+ad)
            \end{align}
        \end{subequations}
        The commutativity and associativity of these operations stems from the
        arithmetic of $\mathbb{R}$, as does the fact that 0 and 1 are identities
        fo these operations.
    \end{example}
    \begin{example}
        There are other Abelian group structures we can place on
        $\mathbb{R}^{2}$. Much the way the arithemtic of $\mathbb{Q}$ was
        developed by building from the arithmetic of $\mathbb{Z}$ and putting
        a structure on $\mathbb{Z}^{2}$, we can do the same of $\mathbb{R}^{2}$.
        Let $*$ be the binary operation on
        $\mathbb{R}\times(\mathbb{R}\setminus\{0\})$ defines as follows:
        \begin{equation}
            (a,\,b)*(c,\,d)=(ad+bc,\,bd)
        \end{equation}
        where $ad$ denotes the uusual real valued multiplication of $a$ and $b$,
        and where $+$ is the usual addition in $\mathbb{R}$. This operation
        will be clearer if we write it out as:
        \begin{equation}
            \frac{a}{b}*\frac{c}{d}
            =\frac{ad+bc}{bd}
        \end{equation}
        Now we see why we required the second entry to be non-zero, this is the
        usually additive operation for fractions of real numbers. As such is is
        associative and commutative. Moreover, there is an identity $(0,1)$, and
        an inverse $(\minus{a},b)$. Thus, we have an Abelian group.
    \end{example}
    \begin{lexample}{Group Operation on Power Set}{Group_Operation_on_Power_Set}
        When studying Boolean algebras we saw that on a set $A$ the
        structure $(\mathcal{P}(A),\cup,\cap)$ does not yield inverse elements.
        That is, given $B,C\subseteq{A}$, if $A\cup{C}=\emptyset$ then
        $A=C=\emptyset$, and if $B\cap{C}=A$, then $A=B=C$. So Boolean algebras
        do not have an underlying group structure. That is, neither
        $(\mathcal{P}(A),\cup)$ not $(\mathcal{P}(A),\cap)$ are groups. We can
        place a group structure on $\mathcal{P}(A)$ by considering another
        familiar operation: The symmetric
        difference\index{Symmetric Difference}, $\ominus$. Recall that this is
        defined as:
        \begin{equation}
            B\ominus{C}=(B\cup{C})\setminus(B\cap{C})
        \end{equation}
        The symmetric difference is both associative and commutative, and
        moreover there is a unital element since $B\ominus\emptyset=B$. Lastly,
        there is an inverse element, since $B\ominus{B}=\emptyset$. Thus,
        $(\mathcal{P}(A),\ominus)$ forms an Abelian group.
    \end{lexample}
    \begin{lexample}{Reflections on a Square}{Group_Reflection_on_a_Square}
        We now consider the reflections on a square, but do not consider
        rotations. We can visualize this by consider a point on one of the
        four verticies of a square and allowing it to move diagonally,
        horizontally, or vertically. Our operation is again the
        \textit{successor} operation. Let's label $h$ as horizontal, and
        similarly $d$ and $v$ for diagonal and vertical. Let $e$ denote the
        \textit{do nothing} reflection. Note that each of these
        \textit{generators} is it's own inverse. Reflecting across the
        diagonal twice is equivalent to doing nothing, as are reflecting twice
        vertically or horizontally. We thus obtain the following restrictions:
        \begin{equation}
            h*h=e
            \quad\quad
            v*v=e
            \quad\quad
            d*d=e
        \end{equation}
        Using these constraints, and the diagram below
        (Fig.~\ref{fig:Group_Reflections_on_a_Square}), we can once again
        compute the Cayley table for this operation.

            \caption{Cayley Table for Reflection on a Square}
            \label{tab:Cayley_Table_Reflection_on_Square}
        \end{table}
        This group is equivalent to the group structure that can be placed on
        $\mathbb{Z}_{2}\times\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ by considering pointwise modular
        addition. For example, we have:
        \begin{equation}
            (0,1)+(1,1)=(0+1,1+1)=(1,0)
        \end{equation}
        and simillary for the other elements. This group structure, called the
        \textit{direct product} of $(\mathbb{Z}_{2},+)$ with itself, is the same
        as the group structure we've described here. By looking at the Cayley
        table we see that the group of reflections on the square is an Abelian
        group. This is contrary to $D_{6}$ where we allowed both rotations and
        reflections and saw that the group is not Abelian.
    \end{lexample}
    \begin{lexample}{Group of Two Coins}{Group_of_Coins}
        Consider two coins located at points $A$ and $B$. We group generated by
        the following operations:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $e$: Do nothing.
            \item $f$: Flip the coin at $A$.
            \item $s$: Swap the coins $A$ and $B$.
        \end{itemize}
        From this we get that there are 8 moves total that can be generated from
        the \textit{successor} operation, which generated by the following
        constraints:
        \begin{equation}
            f^{2}=e
            \quad\quad
            s^{2}=e
        \end{equation}
        That is, flipping the coin at $A$ twice does nothing, nor does swapping
        the two coins twice. We also need one more restraint, and this tells us
        how to flip both coins without swapping them. We can achieve this by
        doing flip-swap-flip-swap, or equivalently by swap-flip-swap-flip. Thus,
        we have one more restraint:
        \begin{equation}
            fsfs=sfsf
        \end{equation}
        This is equivalent to requiring $(fsfs)^{2}=e$. We can now compute the
        table.

    \begin{definition}
        If $(G,*)$ and $(G',\circ)$ are groups and
        $f:G\rightarrow G'$ is a bijective function, then $f$ is said to
        be an isomorphism between $(G,*)$ and $(G',\circ)$ if and only if
        for all $a,b\in{G}$, $f(a*b)=f(a)\circ{f}(b)$.
    \end{definition}
    \begin{theorem}
        If $(G,*)$ and $(G',\circ)$ are isomorphic with identities $e_{*}$
        and $e_{\circ}$ are the identities, then $f(e_{*})=e_{\circ}$.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        $\forall a\in G,\ f(a)=f(a* e_*) = f(a)\circ f(e_*)$ as $f$ is
        an isomorphism. As identities are unique, $f(e_*)=e_{\circ}$.

    \begin{theorem}
        If $(G,*)$ and $(G',\circ)$ are isomorphic, with isomorphism $f$, and if

    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        For:
        \begin{equation}
            e_{\circ}=f(e_*)
                     =f(a*a^{-1})
                     =f(a^{-1}*a)
                     =f(a)\circ f(a^{-1})
                     =f(a^{-1})\circ f(a)
        \end{equation}
        As inverses are unique, $f(a^{-1})=f(a)^{-1}$.

            \item If $b*a=c*a$, then $b=c$.
